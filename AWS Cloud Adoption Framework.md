# What Is the AWS CAF

The AWS Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF) is a comprehensive guide developed by Amazon Web Services to help organizations plan and execute their journey to the cloud. 

>It provides structured guidance, best practices, and actionable recommendations for successfully adopting [[cloud computing]] on AWS, regardless of your organization's size or industry.

- Business doesn't see value

**Problem 3:** "We lack cloud skills"

**Problem 4:** "Our migration failed"
- Moved apps without planning
- Security vulnerabilities
- Cost overruns
- Performance issues

# Why CAF Exists

Cloud adoption requires alignment of three elements:

1. **People** (stakeholders, skills, culture)
2. **Process** (workflows, governance, operations)
3. **Technology** (infrastructure, services, architecture)

**The shift**: Cloud computing introduces significant changes in:

- How technology is obtained, used, and managed
- How organizations budget and pay for technology
- Organizational structure and responsibilities

**The need**: Organizations must discuss and consider fundamental changes across the entire organization, with stakeholder support from all units (within and outside IT).
