Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services, including [[servers]], [[storage]], [[databases]], [[networking]], [[software]], analytics, and intelligence—over the internet (the "cloud") on a pay-as-you-go basis. Instead of owning and maintaining physical data centers and servers, you can access technology services from a cloud provider.

Think of it as renting computing power and storage instead of buying and maintaining your own computers.
