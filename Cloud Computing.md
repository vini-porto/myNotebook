# What is Cloud Computing

Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services, including [[servers]], [[storage]], [[databases]], [[networking]], [[software]], analytics, and intelligence over the [[internet]] ("cloud"). 

>Instead of owning and maintaining physical data centers and servers, you can access technology services from a cloud provider.

# Core Characteristics of Cloud Computing

1. **On-Demand Self-Service:** You can provision computing resources automatically without human interaction with the service provider.
2. **Broad Network Access:** Services are available over the network and accessed through standard mechanisms (web browsers, mobile apps, APIs).
3. **Resource Pooling:** The provider's computing resources serve multiple customers using a multi-tenant model.
4. **Rapid Elasticity:** Resources can be scaled up or down quickly to meet demand.
5. Measured Service: Resource usage is monitored, controlled, and reported, providing transparency.
