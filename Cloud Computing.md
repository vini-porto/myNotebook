# What is Cloud Computing

Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services, including [[Servers]], [[storage]], [[databases]], [[networking]], [[software]], analytics, and intelligence over the [[internet]] ("cloud"). 

>Instead of owning and maintaining physical data centers and servers, you can access technology services from a cloud provider.

# Core Characteristics of Cloud Computing

1. **On-Demand Self-Service:** You can provision computing resources automatically without human interaction with the service provider.
2. **Broad Network Access:** Services are available over the network and accessed through standard mechanisms (web browsers, mobile apps, APIs).
3. **Resource Pooling:** The provider's computing resources serve multiple customers using a multi-tenant model.
4. **Rapid Elasticity:** Resources can be scaled up or down quickly to meet demand.
5. Measured Service: Resource usage is monitored, controlled, and reported, providing transparency.

# Cloud Service Models

## IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)

>Rent fundamental computing infrastructure—virtual machines, storage, networks.

---

**You Manage**:

- Operating systems
- Applications
- Data
- Runtime
- Middleware

**Provider Manages**:

- Virtualization
- Servers
- Storage
- Networking

### IaaS Providers:

- Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)
- Microsoft Azure Virtual Machines
- Google Compute Engine
- DigitalOcean Droplets

## PaaS (Platform as a Service)

>A platform for developing, running, and managing applications without dealing with infrastructure.

---

**You Manage**:

- Applications
- Data

**Provider Manages**:

- Runtime
- Middleware
- Operating System
- Virtualization
- Servers
- Storage
- Networking

### PaaS Providers:

- Heroku
- Google App Engine
- Microsoft Azure App Service
- AWS Elastic Beanstalk

## SaaS (Software as a Service)

>Complete software applications delivered over the internet. You just use them.

---

**You Manage**:

- Your data and settings

**Provider Manages**:

- Everything else (application, data, runtime, middleware, OS, infrastructure)

**SaaS Providers:**

- Gmail, Outlook.com
- Google Docs, Microsoft 365
- Salesforce
- Dropbox
- Slack
- Netflix
- Zoom

# Cloud Deployment Models

## Public Cloud

Services offered over the public internet and available to anyone who wants to purchase them.

**Characteristics**:

- Shared infrastructure
- Resources pooled for multiple customers
- Pay-as-you-go pricing
- Managed by third-party provider

**Examples**: AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform

## Private Cloud

Infrastructure used exclusively by a single organization, either on-premises or hosted by a third party.

**Characteristics**:

- Dedicated infrastructure
- Single organization
- More control and customization
- Can be on-premises or hosted

**Examples**: VMware vCloud, OpenStack (self-hosted)

## Hybrid Cloud

Combination of public and private clouds, allowing data and applications to be shared between them.

**Characteristics**:

- Mix of on-premises, private cloud, and public cloud
- Data and apps can move between clouds
- Greater flexibility
- Optimized resource usage

## Multi-Cloud

Using multiple cloud providers (multiple public clouds).

**Example**: Using AWS for compute, Google Cloud for machine learning, Azure for databases

**Pros**:

- No vendor lock-in
- Best-of-breed services
- Risk mitigation
- Geographic distribution

**Cons**:

- Complex management
- Different interfaces/APIs
- Potential higher costs
