A compiled programming language is a language whose involves a **compiler** translating the entire source code into native [[Machine Code]] before the program is run. Resulting in an independent executable file.

# Characteristics

1. **Translation Process:** Source code is analyzed and translated into machine code (built)
2. **Execution Speed:** The resulting executable runs very fast because it is already in the processor's native language.
3. **Performance:** Compiled languages are often used for applications where performance, speed, and granular control over hardware resources (e.g. memory and CPU usage) 
4. **Portability:** The generated machine code is specific to the target CPU architecture and operating system, so the program must be recompiled for each different platform it needs to run on.
5. **Error Detection:** Most errors are detected during the compilation phase
