In an **interpreted programming language** instructions are executed directly by a program called an **interpreter**, without requiring the source code to be converted into machine code beforehand.

---

# Characteristics

**Execution Process:** The interpreter reads the source code one statement at a time, translates that statement into machine code, and executes it immediately.

**No Prior Compilation:** there is no separate "build" step that creates a executable file

**Platform Independence:** The same source code can run on any machine that has a compatible interpreter installed.

**Flexibility and Rapid Development:** This model allows for dynamic typing, easier debugging, and the ability to modify code and see results immediately.
