**Amazon Web Services** (AWS) is a secure cloud platform that offers a broad set of global cloud-based products called **services**.

### Key Characteristics of AWS

**On-demand access**: Immediate access to compute, storage, network, database, and other IT resources via the internet.

**Flexibility**: Your AWS environment can be:

- Reconfigured and updated on-demand
- Scaled up or down automatically to meet usage patterns
- Optimized to reduce spending
- Shut down temporarily or permanently

**Billing model**: AWS services transform IT spending from **[[Capital Expense]]** to **[[Operational Expense]]**.

**Designed to work together**: Services function like building blocks that assemble quickly to build sophisticated, scalable solutions that adjust as needs change.

## What are Web Services?

A **[[Web Service]]** is any piece of software that makes itself available over the internet or private networks.

**Characteristics**:

- Uses standardized formats like [[XML]] or [[JSON]] for requests and responses
- Uses [[APIs]] (Application Programming Interfaces) for interaction
- Not tied to any specific operating system or programming language
- Self-describing via an interface definition file
- Discoverable by other services
