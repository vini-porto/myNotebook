# Aggregate Functions (The Math)

### The Core Concept: Squashing Rows

Normal SQL returns **one row per record**. [[Aggregate Functions]] collapse many rows into **one summary row**.

Think of it like this: instead of listing every receipt in a store, you just want the total sales for the day.

---

### COUNT() – The Headcount

Counts the number of rows (or non-null values in a column).

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Minions;
-- Result: 10,000
```

**Important distinction:**

- `COUNT(*)` – counts **all rows**, including those with NULLs
- `COUNT(ColumnName)` – counts only **non-NULL values** in that column

```sql
SELECT COUNT(ReportsToID) FROM Minions;
-- If Gru's ReportsToID is NULL, he is NOT counted!
```

> Nulls are invisible to `COUNT(column)`. Always know which version you need.

---

### SUM() – The Bill

Adds up all values in a numeric column.

```sql
SELECT SUM(Cost) FROM Parts;
-- Result: $1,000,000
```

**Constraint:** Only works on **number columns**.

---

### AVG() – The Average

Calculates the mean value across a column.

```sql
SELECT AVG(Cost) FROM Parts;
```

---

### MIN() and MAX() – The Extremes

Find the lowest or highest value in a column.

```sql
SELECT MAX(Cost) FROM Parts;  -- Most expensive item
SELECT MIN(Cost) FROM Parts;  -- Cheapest item
```

---

### Combining Multiple Aggregates

You can run several aggregates in a single query:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS TotalParts,
       MAX(Cost) AS MostExpensive,
       AVG(Cost) AS AveragePrice
FROM Parts;
```

> **Summary:** Aggregate functions (COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX) turn many rows into one number. They operate on an entire column — or a group of rows when combined with GROUP BY.

---

## Part 2 – GROUP BY & HAVING (The Buckets)

### The Problem Aggregates Alone Can't Solve

`AVG(Cost)` gives one average for the whole table. But what if you want the average **per bot model**? You need **buckets**.

---

### GROUP BY – Sorting Into Buckets

[[GROUP BY]] divides rows into groups _before_ applying aggregates. Each group gets its own calculation.

**Analogy:** Imagine three physical buckets on the floor, one per bot model. You drop each row into the right bucket, then count/sum/average what's inside each bucket separately.

```sql
SELECT ModelName, COUNT(BotID)
FROM Bots
GROUP BY ModelName;
```

Result:

- Cookie-Bot 3000: 4 units
- Mega-Cookie: 1 unit

---

### The Golden Rule of GROUP BY

> **Every column in SELECT must either be in GROUP BY or wrapped in an aggregate function.**

```sql
-- ERROR: Status is not grouped and not aggregated
SELECT ModelName, Status, COUNT(*)
FROM Bots
GROUP BY ModelName;
```

Fix it by adding `Status` to `GROUP BY`:

```sql
SELECT ModelName, Status, COUNT(*)
FROM Bots
GROUP BY ModelName, Status;
```

---

### HAVING – Filtering the Buckets

[[HAVING]] filters _groups_ **after** they've been formed. You cannot use `WHERE` for this because `WHERE` runs before grouping.

**WHERE vs. HAVING — the key difference:**

|Clause|Filters|Timing|
|---|---|---|
|`WHERE`|Individual **rows**|Before grouping|
|`HAVING`|Entire **groups**|After grouping|

**Analogy:** `WHERE` checks each person at the door. `HAVING` checks the crowd after they've gathered.

```sql
SELECT ModelName, COUNT(*)
FROM Bots
WHERE Status = 'Active'       -- Filter rows first
GROUP BY ModelName
HAVING COUNT(*) > 2;          -- Then filter groups
```

Logic: Keep only Active bots → bucket by model → count → discard small buckets.

---

### Combining JOINs with Aggregates

Real-world questions often require both.

**Question:** How many bots did Kevin build?

```sql
SELECT m.Name, COUNT(a.BotID)
FROM Minions m
JOIN Assignments a ON m.MinionID = a.MinionID
GROUP BY m.Name;
```

**Question:** Total cost of parts per bot model?

```sql
SELECT b.ModelName, SUM(p.Cost * bom.Qty)
FROM Bots b
JOIN BillOfMaterials bom ON b.BotID = bom.BotID
JOIN Parts p ON bom.PartID = p.PartID
GROUP BY b.ModelName;
```

> **Summary:** GROUP BY buckets your data; HAVING filters those buckets. WHERE cannot filter aggregated results — that's HAVING's job.

---

## Part 3 – Scalar Functions (The Cleanup)

### Scalar vs. Aggregate

|Type|Input|Output|Used for|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Aggregate** (COUNT, SUM)|Many rows|1 value|Summarizing|
|**[[Scalar Functions]]** (UPPER, ROUND)|1 row|1 row|Transforming|

Scalar functions work **row by row** — they don't collapse data.

You **can** mix them:

```sql
SELECT UPPER(Name), COUNT(*) ... GROUP BY Name
```

---

### String Functions

**UPPER() / LOWER()** – change text case

```sql
SELECT UPPER(Name) FROM Minions;     -- KEVIN, STUART, BOB
WHERE LOWER(Name) = 'kevin';        -- case-insensitive search
```

**LENGTH()** – count characters

```sql
SELECT Name, LENGTH(Name)
FROM Minions
WHERE LENGTH(Name) < 5;
-- Result: Bob (3), Dave (4)
```

**SUBSTRING()** – extract part of a string

```sql
-- Syntax: SUBSTRING(Column, Start, Length)
SELECT SUBSTRING(Name, 1, 1) FROM Minions;
-- Result: K, S, B, D (first initials)
```

**CONCAT() / ||** – join strings together

```sql
-- SQLite / PostgreSQL:
SELECT Name || ' is a Minion' AS Description FROM Minions;
-- MySQL:
SELECT CONCAT(Name, ' is a Minion') AS Description FROM Minions;
-- Result: 'Kevin is a Minion'
```

---

### Math Functions

**ROUND()** – limit decimal places

```sql
SELECT ROUND(AVG(Cost), 2) FROM Parts;
-- Result: $176.49 (not $176.333333...)
```

**ABS()** – absolute value (remove the negative sign)

```sql
SELECT ABS(-500);
-- Result: 500
```

Useful when calculating differences where direction doesn't matter.

---

### Date Functions

**NOW() / DATE('now')** – get the current date

```sql
SELECT DATE('now');
-- Result: 2026-02-03
```

**Days since a date:**

```sql
SELECT julianday('now') - julianday(BuildDate) FROM Bots;
```

---

### Type & Null Functions

**CAST()** – convert a value from one data type to another

```sql
SELECT CAST(Cost AS INTEGER) * 2 FROM Parts;
-- Forces text '500' to behave as the number 500
```

**COALESCE()** – replace NULLs with a default value

```sql
SELECT m.Name, COALESCE(a.Shift, 'Lazy') AS Status
FROM Minions m
LEFT JOIN Assignments a ON m.MinionID = a.MinionID;
-- If Shift is NULL, display 'Lazy' instead
```

> **Summary:** Scalar functions clean and format data one row at a time. They can appear in SELECT, WHERE, and even inside aggregate functions.

---

## Part 4 – The Order of Execution

This is the sequence SQL **actually** processes a query — not the order you write it:

|Step|Clause|What happens|
|---|---|---|
|1|`FROM / JOIN`|Load the table(s)|
|2|`WHERE`|Filter individual rows|
|3|`GROUP BY`|Form groups/buckets|
|4|`HAVING`|Filter groups|
|5|`SELECT`|Calculate scalars & aggregates|
|6|`ORDER BY`|Sort the result|
|7|`LIMIT`|Cut the result|

**Mnemonic to remember the order:**

> **F**ind **W**eird **G**ru **H**ats, **S**o **O**thers **L**augh (FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING, SELECT, ORDER BY, LIMIT)

This order explains **why** you can't use `WHERE` to filter aggregates — WHERE runs at step 2, before groups even exist.

---

## The Ultimate Report Query

Pulling it all together — all caps names, rounded costs, only for expensive minions:

```sql
SELECT UPPER(m.Name), ROUND(SUM(p.Cost), 0) AS TotalCost
FROM Minions m
JOIN Assignments a ON m.MinionID = a.MinionID
JOIN Bots b ON a.BotID = b.BotID
JOIN BillOfMaterials bom ON b.BotID = bom.BotID
JOIN Parts p ON bom.PartID = p.PartID
GROUP BY m.Name
HAVING SUM(p.Cost) > 100;
```

---

## Summary Checklist

- **Aggregates** (COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX) – math on a whole column, returns one row per group
- **Scalar functions** (UPPER, ROUND, LENGTH, COALESCE) – transform individual values, row by row
- **GROUP BY** – divides data into buckets for separate aggregate calculations
- **HAVING** – filters groups _after_ aggregation (WHERE filters rows _before_)
- **Order of execution** – FROM → WHERE → GROUP BY → HAVING → SELECT → ORDER BY → LIMIT

## Practice Questions

1. What is the difference between `COUNT(*)` and `COUNT(ColumnName)`? When would each give a different result?
2. Write a query that returns each bot model and the total number of bots built, but only for models with more than 5 units.
3. Why can't you use `WHERE COUNT(*) > 5`? What should you use instead, and where does it go in the query?
4. A column stores prices as text (e.g., `'199'`). What function lets you do math with it?
5. You run `SELECT AVG(Cost) FROM Parts`. How would you change this to get the average cost _per supplier_?
6. What does `COALESCE(a.Shift, 'Unassigned')` do? In what type of JOIN is this particularly useful?
7. A classmate writes `SELECT ModelName, Status, COUNT(*) FROM Bots GROUP BY ModelName`. What is wrong with this query?
8. In what order does SQL process the clauses `WHERE`, `HAVING`, `GROUP BY`, and `SELECT`?
