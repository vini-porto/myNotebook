# AWS Pricing Model

There are three fundamental drivers of cost with AWS:

1. **[[Compute]]**: Processing power (CPU, memory)
2. **[[Storage]]**: Data storage (databases, file storage, backups)
3. **[[Outbound Data Transfer]]**: Data leaving AWS

>[!NOTE] Important notes
>- **No charge** for inbound data transfer in most cases
>- **No charge** for data transfer between AWS services within the same [[AWS Region]]
>- **Outbound data transfer** is aggregated across services and billed as "AWS Data Transfer Out"
>- Always verify data transfer rates before using a service—there are exceptions

### Core AWS Pricing Philosophy

AWS pricing is based on a simple principle: **pay for what you use**. Key characteristics:

- Start or stop using a product at any time
- No long-term contracts required
- Pay at the end of each month for actual usage
- [[Utility-Style Pricing]]—like electricity or water

# The Four Pillars of AWS Pricing

## 1. Pay for What You Use

**Benefits**:

- Lower **[[Variable Costs]]**
- No need to build costly infrastructure
- No purchasing servers or software licenses
- No leasing facilities
- Quickly adapt to changing business needs
- Redirect focus to innovation and invention
- Pay only for what you use and for as long as you need it

**Availability**: All AWS services are available on-demand with no long-term contracts and no complex licensing dependencies.

### 2. Pay Less When You Reserve

For certain services like [[Amazon EC2]] and [[Amazon RDS]], you can invest in **[[Reserved Capacity]]**.

**Savings**: Up to **75% discount** over equivalent on-demand capacity.

**Three Reserved Instance Options**:

**[[All Upfront Reserved Instance]]** (AURI):

- Pay everything upfront
- Receive the largest discount
- Best for cost minimization

**[[Partial Upfront Reserved Instance]]** (PURI):

- Pay some upfront, rest over time
- Lower discount than AURI
- Balance between upfront cost and savings

**[[No Upfront Reserved Instance]]** (NURI):

- Pay nothing upfront
- Smallest discount
- Frees capital for other projects

>[!NOTE] Benefits: 
>Minimize risks, predictably manage budgets, comply with policies requiring longer-term commitments.

### 3. Pay Less By Using More

**[[Volume-Based Discounts]]**: Get better pricing as your usage increases.

**Example**: [[Amazon S3]] uses **[[Tiered Pricing]]**:

- Pay less per GB when you use more
- Data transfer IN is always free
- Storage costs decrease based on your needs

>**Economy of scale benefit**: As your AWS usage increases, you benefit from economies of scale that help you:

- Increase adoption
- Keep costs under control
- Access better pricing tiers

>**Strategic advantage**: The AWS storage services portfolio offers options to lower pricing based on:

- How frequently you access data
- Performance requirements for retrieval

Choose the right combination of storage solutions to reduce costs while preserving performance, security, and durability.

### 4. Pay Less as AWS Grows

AWS constantly works to reduce costs:

- Lower data center hardware costs
- Improved operational efficiencies
- Reduced power consumption
- Lower cost of doing business

**Result**: Substantial economies of scale = savings passed to customers as lower pricing.

**Additional benefit**: Future, higher-performing resources replace current ones for no extra charge.

### Custom Pricing

AWS recognizes that every customer has different needs.

**When standard pricing doesn't work**: [[Custom Pricing]] is available for:

- High-volume projects
- Unique requirements
- Enterprise-level deployments

## AWS Free Tier

**[[AWS Free Tier]]**: Helps new AWS customers get started in the cloud.

**Availability**: New customers for up to 1 year

**What's included**:

- Free [[Amazon EC2]] T2 micro instance for a year

- Resources decrease automatically during demand lulls
- Maintains performance while minimizing cost

**Cost**: Free (you pay for the scaled resources, like EC2 instances)

### AWS OpsWorks

**[[AWS OpsWorks]]**: Application management service for deploying and operating applications of all sizes.

**Cost**: Free (you pay for underlying resources)

## Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)

### On-Premises vs. Cloud

The fundamental question many businesses face: **on-premises or cloud?**

The difference is in deployment method:

### On-Premises Infrastructure

**[[On-Premises Infrastructure]]**: Installed locally on a company's computers and servers.

**Characteristics**:

- Several **[[Fixed Costs]]** (also called [[Capital Expenses]])
- Includes: facilities, hardware, licenses, maintenance staff
- **Scaling up**: Expensive and time-consuming
- **Scaling down**: Does NOT reduce fixed costs

### Cloud Infrastructure

**[[Cloud Infrastructure]]**: Purchased from a service provider who builds and maintains facilities, hardware, and staff.

**Characteristics**:

- Customer pays for what is used
- **Scaling up or down**: Simple and flexible
- **Costs**: Easy to estimate based on service use
- [[Consumption-Based Costs]]

### Comparing the Models

**Challenge**: It's difficult to compare on-premises IT with AWS Cloud because they use different concepts and terms.

**On-premises discussion involves**:

- Capital expenditure
- Long planning cycles
- Multiple components to buy, build, manage, and refresh

**AWS Cloud discussion involves**:

- Flexibility
- Agility
- Consumption-based costs

## What is Total Cost of Ownership?

**[[Total Cost of Ownership]]** (TCO): A financial estimate to help buyers and owners determine direct and indirect costs of a product or system.

**Includes**:

- Cost of the service itself
- ALL costs associated with owning the service

**Purpose**: Compare costs of running infrastructure in different environments:

- On-premises or colocation facility
- Cloud-based infrastructure

**Use cases**:

- Budgeting purposes
- Building business cases for optimal deployment decisions

### TCO Considerations

When calculating TCO, consider:

**[[Server Costs]]**:

- Hardware
- Software
- Facilities to house equipment

**[[Storage Costs]]**:

- Hardware
- Administration
- Facilities

**[[Network Costs]]**:

- Hardware
- Administration
- Facilities

**[[IT Labor Costs]]**:

- Required to administer the entire solution

### Cloud vs. On-Premises Cost Assessment

**Cloud costs**: Most costs are upfront and readily calculated.

- Transparent pricing based on usage metrics (RAM, storage, bandwidth)
- Pricing frequently fixed per unit of time
- Customers gain certainty and can calculate costs based on usage estimates

**On-premises costs**: Sometimes difficult to determine, must account for:

- **Direct costs**: Power, floor space, storage, IT operations
- **Indirect costs**: Network infrastructure, storage infrastructure

**Additional cost categories** (not exhaustive):

- Software: Database, management, middle-tier
- Facilities: Upgrades, maintenance, building security, taxes
- IT labor: Security administration, application administration

## On-Premises vs. All-in-Cloud: Sample Comparison

### Example Scenario

**On-premises environment**:

- 1 virtual machine with 4 CPUs, 16 GB RAM, Linux OS
- Average utilization: 100%
- Optimized by RAM

**Comparable AWS environment**:

- 1 m4.xlarge instance (4 CPUs, 16 GB RAM)
- 3-year Partial Upfront Reserved Instance

### Results (3-Year Comparison)

**On-premises 3-year total cost**: $167,422

**AWS Cloud 3-year total cost**: $7,509

**Savings**: **96%** reduction ($159,913 saved over 3 years)

### Why the Difference?

**On-premises**: Predicted costs that continue whether capacity is used or not.

**AWS**: Commissioned when needed, decommissioned when no longer in use = lower overall cost.

## AWS Pricing Calculator

## Additional Benefit Considerations

### Hard Benefits

**[[Hard Benefits]]**: Quantifiable, direct cost reductions.

**Examples**:

- Reduced spending on compute, storage, networking, security
- Reductions in hardware and software purchases
- Reduced operational costs
- Lower backup and disaster recovery costs
- Reduction in operations personnel

### Cloud TCO vs. ROI

**[[Cloud TCO]]**: What will be spent on technology after adoption—the cost to run the solution.

**Typical TCO analysis**: Compares as-is on-premises infrastructure with to-be cloud infrastructure.

**Limitation**: Provides only a narrow view of total financial impact.

**[[Return on Investment]]** (ROI): Determines value generated while considering spending and saving.

**ROI process**:

1. Identify hard benefits (direct cost reductions and efficiency improvements)
2. Identify soft savings (harder to quantify but potentially more valuable)

### Soft Benefits

**[[Soft Benefits]]**: Value points challenging to accurately quantify, but can be more valuable than hard savings.

**Examples**:

- **Reusability**: Reuse services and applications to define and redefine solutions
- **Increased developer productivity**: Faster development cycles
- **Improved customer satisfaction**: Better performance and reliability
- **Agile business processes**: Quickly respond to new opportunities
- **Increased global reach**: Deploy worldwide in minutes

**Importance**: Understanding both hard and soft benefits reveals the full value of cloud migration.

- Creates a hierarchical structure
- Like an upside-down tree with root at top

**[[Account]]**: Standard AWS account containing your AWS resources.

**Structure visualization**:

```
Root (Organization)
├── OU 1
│   ├── Account A
│   └── Account B
├── OU 2
│   ├── OU 2a
│   │   └── Account C
│   └── Account D
└── Account E
```

**Hierarchy rules**:

- An OU can have only one parent
- Each account can be a member of exactly one OU
- Policies attached to nodes flow down to all branches and leaves

## Key Features and Benefits

**AWS Organizations enables you to**:

**1. Service Control Policies**:

## Security with AWS Organizations

### IAM vs. Service Control Policies

**AWS Organizations does NOT replace [[IAM]] policies**.

**[[IAM Policies]]**:

- Allow or deny access to AWS services (e.g., Amazon S3)
- Can target individual AWS resources (e.g., specific S3 bucket)
- Can target individual API actions (e.g., `s3:CreateBucket`)
- Apply only to IAM users, groups, or roles
- **Cannot restrict** the AWS account root user

**[[Service Control Policies]]** (SCPs):

- Allow or deny access to AWS services for entire accounts or groups of accounts
- Apply to individual AWS accounts or OUs
- Affect ALL IAM users, groups, and roles in an account
- **Can restrict** the AWS account root user

**Key difference**: SCPs provide account-level guardrails, while IAM provides user/role-level permissions.

## Organizations Setup Process

**Assumptions**: You have access to two existing AWS accounts and can sign in as administrator.

**Step 1**: Create your organization

- Use current AWS account as [[Primary Account]]
- Invite one AWS account to join
- Create another account as [[Member Account]]

**Step 2**: Create organizational units

- Create two OUs in your organization
- Place member accounts in those OUs

**Step 3**: Create service control policies

- Apply restrictions on actions delegated to users and roles
- Control what member accounts can do

**Step 4**: Test your organization's policies

- Sign in as a user for each role
- See how SCPs impact account access
- Use [[IAM Policy Simulator]] to test and troubleshoot policies

## Limits of AWS Organizations

## Practical Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Choosing a Reserved Instance Type

Your company runs a database that operates 24/7 for the next 3 years. You have $50,000 in budget available upfront, but leadership wants to minimize total cost. Which Reserved Instance type should you choose (AURI, PURI, or NURI) and why?

### Scenario 2: TCO Analysis

You're migrating a workload from on-premises to AWS. The on-premises solution costs:

- Hardware: $100,000 upfront
- Facilities: $2,000/month
- IT Labor: $8,000/month
- Software licenses: $15,000/year

The AWS solution costs:

- EC2 Reserved Instances: $500/month
- Storage: $300/month
- Data transfer: $200/month

Calculate the 3-year TCO for both options. Which is more cost-effective and by how much?

### Scenario 3: Support Plan Selection

Your startup is launching a new e-commerce platform. You have:

- 3 developers (not AWS experts)
- Production launch in 2 months
- Limited budget but need to ensure uptime
- No in-house AWS expertise

Which support plan should you choose? Justify your decision considering budget, response times, and available resources.

### Scenario 4: AWS Organizations Design

Your company has:

- Corporate IT department
- Development team
- Production environment
- Testing environment
- Finance team requiring separate billing visibility

Design an AWS Organizations structure with appropriate OUs. Explain your organizational hierarchy and why you structured it that way.

### Scenario 5: Cost Optimization

You notice your AWS bill has increased 40% over the last 3 months. Which AWS tools would you use to: a) Identify which services are driving the cost increase? b) Forecast next month's spending? c) Set up alerts to prevent future unexpected increases? d) Optimize your resource usage?

---

## Discussion Topics

1. **Reserved Instances vs. Flexibility**: Reserved Instances offer significant savings but require commitment. When does the flexibility of on-demand pricing outweigh the cost savings of reserved capacity?
    
2. **Cloud Migration ROI**: Beyond direct cost savings, what "soft benefits" might be most valuable to different types of organizations (startups vs. enterprises, tech companies vs. traditional businesses)?
    
3. **Support Plan Economics**: Is it worth paying for Enterprise Support if you have a strong in-house AWS team? What factors should influence this decision?
    
4. **Organizational Structure**: How should you balance security (strict OU boundaries) with flexibility (easier cross-team collaboration) when designing AWS Organizations?
    
5. **TCO Blind Spots**: What costs are commonly overlooked when calculating on-premises TCO? What about cloud TCO? How can organizations ensure accurate comparisons?

## Calculation Practice

### Exercise 1: Reserved Instance Savings

- On-Demand cost: $1,000/month
- Reserved Instance (AURI): $7,000 upfront for 3 years
- Calculate: (a) Total 3-year on-demand cost, (b) Percentage savings with RI

### Exercise 2: Volume Pricing

Amazon S3 tiered pricing:

- First 50 TB: $0.023 per GB
