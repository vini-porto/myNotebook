# AWS Compute Services Overview

## Introduction to AWS Compute Options

[[Amazon Web Services]] (AWS) provides multiple compute services, each designed for specific use cases. Think of compute services as different ways to run your applications in the cloud - some give you full control over virtual machines, others handle everything automatically, and some fall in between.

### The Four Main Categories

AWS compute services fall into four broad categories:

1. **[[Virtual Machines]] ([[Infrastructure as a Service]])** - You manage the operating system and applications
2. **[[Serverless Computing]]** - AWS manages everything; you just provide code
3. **[[Container-Based Services]]** - Run multiple isolated applications on shared infrastructure
4. **[[Platform as a Service]]** - AWS manages infrastructure; you focus on your application

---

## Core AWS Compute Services

### Virtual Machine Services

**[[Amazon EC2]]** (Elastic Compute Cloud) provides resizable virtual machines where you have full control. You choose the operating system, configure the server size, and manage the software.

**[[Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling]]** automatically adjusts the number of EC2 instances based on conditions you define. This ensures your application remains available during traffic spikes while minimizing costs during quiet periods.

**[[VMware Cloud on AWS]]** enables hybrid cloud deployments without requiring custom hardware, useful for organizations with existing VMware investments.

### Serverless Services

**[[AWS Lambda]]** is a serverless compute solution where you run code without managing servers. You only pay for the actual compute time your code uses - measured in milliseconds.

**[[AWS Serverless Application Repository]]** provides a catalog where you can discover, deploy, and publish serverless applications.

### Container Services

**[[Amazon ECS]]** (Elastic Container Service) orchestrates [[Docker]] containers, managing where and how containers run across your infrastructure.

**[[Amazon EKS]]** (Elastic Kubernetes Service) runs managed [[Kubernetes]] clusters, enabling you to use Kubernetes without operating the control plane yourself.

**[[Amazon ECR]]** (Elastic Container Registry) stores and retrieves Docker container images, integrating seamlessly with ECS and EKS.

**[[AWS Fargate]]** runs containers without requiring you to manage the underlying servers or clusters.

### Platform Services

**[[AWS Elastic Beanstalk]]** provides a simple platform for deploying web applications. You upload your code, and Beanstalk handles deployment, scaling, and infrastructure management.

**[[AWS Batch]]** runs batch computing jobs at any scale, automatically provisioning resources based on workload requirements.

**[[Amazon Lightsail]]** offers a simplified service for building applications or websites, ideal for simpler use cases.

### Hybrid and Edge Services

**[[AWS Outposts]]** enables you to run select AWS services in your on-premises data center, extending AWS infrastructure to your location.

---

## Choosing the Right Compute Service

### Key Considerations

The optimal compute service depends on your specific use case. Consider:

- **Legacy code requirements** - Does your application need specific operating systems or libraries?
- **Management overhead** - How much server management can your team handle?
- **Scalability needs** - Does your workload have predictable or variable traffic patterns?
- **Cost optimization** - What's the balance between control and operational efficiency?

### Best Practices

1. **Evaluate available options** - Don't default to familiar solutions; assess all possibilities
2. **Understand configuration options** - Each service offers different customization levels
3. **Collect metrics** - Use data to inform decisions, not assumptions
4. **Use elasticity** - Take advantage of cloud-native scaling capabilities
5. **Re-evaluate regularly** - As your application evolves, your compute needs may change

**Example**: You might start with [[Amazon EC2]] for familiarity, then migrate to containers with [[Amazon ECS]] for better resource utilization, and eventually move some functions to [[AWS Lambda]] for event-driven workloads.

# Amazon EC2 Deep Dive

## Understanding EC2

[[Amazon EC2]] (Elastic Compute Cloud) provides virtual machines in the cloud. The name breaks down as:

- **Elastic** - Easily increase or decrease server count and size
- **Compute** - Provides processing power (CPU) and memory (RAM)
- **Cloud** - Instances are hosted in AWS data centers

### Why EC2 Exists

Traditional on-premises servers have significant drawbacks:

- **High upfront costs** - Purchase hardware before knowing actual needs
- **Wasted capacity** - Servers must handle peak loads, sitting idle during normal times
- **Maintenance burden** - Buildings, staff, cooling, and power are expensive

EC2 solves these problems by providing virtual machines on-demand, where you pay only for what you use.

### Common Use Cases

EC2 instances can host virtually any server workload:

- Application servers and web servers
- Database servers
- Game servers and media servers
- File servers and mail servers
- Computing servers for data processing

## EC2 Instance Fundamentals

### Operating Systems

EC2 supports multiple operating systems:

- **Windows**: Windows Server 2008, 2012, 2016, 2019
- **Linux**: Red Hat, SUSE, Ubuntu, Amazon Linux

The operating system running on a virtual machine is called the **[[guest operating system]]**, distinguishing it from the **[[host operating system]]** that runs directly on physical hardware.

### Key Features

- Launch any number of instances of any size
- Deploy in any [[Availability Zone]] worldwide
- Launch within minutes
- Control traffic with [[security groups]]
- Integrate with other AWS services

## Launching an EC2 Instance

### The Nine Essential Steps

When launching an EC2 instance, you make nine key decisions:

#### 1. Select an [[Amazon Machine Image]] (AMI)

An **AMI** is a template containing:

- **Root volume template** - Operating system and pre-installed software
- **Launch permissions** - Which AWS accounts can use it
- **Block device mapping** - Storage volumes to attach

**AMI Sources**:

- **Quick Start** - AWS-provided pre-built images (safest option)
- **My AMIs** - Custom AMIs you've created
- **[[AWS Marketplace]]** - Third-party software solutions
- **Community AMIs** - User-created (use cautiously; not verified by AWS)

**Creating Custom AMIs**: You can start with an existing AMI, customize an instance (your "golden instance"), then save it as a new AMI. This new AMI becomes your standardized starting point.

#### 2. Select an [[Instance Type]]

Instance types define the hardware resources (CPU, memory, storage, network) your instance receives.

**Naming Convention**:

- `t3.2xlarge` breaks down as:
    - `t` = family name
    - `3` = generation number (higher = newer, better value)
    - `2xlarge` = size (each step up typically doubles resources)

**Categories**:

- **[[General Purpose Instances]]** (T3) - Balanced resources, burstable performance
- **[[Compute Optimized Instances]]** (C5) - High-performance processors
- **[[Memory Optimized Instances]]** (R5) - Large amounts of RAM
- **[[Storage Optimized Instances]]** - High disk throughput
- **[[Accelerated Computing Instances]]** - GPU or specialized hardware

**Example**: A `t3.medium` provides baseline CPU performance with burst capability, ideal for web servers with variable traffic. A `c5.large` provides consistent high CPU, better for batch processing.

#### 3. Specify Network Settings

You must specify:

- **[[VPC]]** (Virtual Private Cloud) - Your isolated network
- **Subnet** - Which [[Availability Zone]] to deploy in
- **Public IP** - Whether the instance needs internet accessibility

**Default VPC** instances automatically receive public IPs. **Non-default VPC** instances don't unless you specify otherwise or configure the subnet.

**[[Placement Groups]]** let you specify how instances are physically arranged to optimize for either high availability (spread apart) or low latency (placed close together).

#### 4. Attach [[IAM Role]] (Optional but Recommended)

Never store AWS credentials on an EC2 instance. Instead, attach an **[[IAM role]]** that grants permissions.

**How it works**:

- Define what the application needs (e.g., read S3 buckets)
- Create an IAM role with those permissions
- Attach role to the instance
- Applications automatically receive temporary credentials

**Instance profiles** are containers for IAM roles - when using the console, AWS creates matching instance profiles automatically.

#### 5. User Data Script (Optional)

**[[User data]]** scripts automate instance configuration at launch. Use them to:

- Install software updates
- Download and install applications
- Configure settings
- Fetch license keys

**Example Linux script**:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
yum update -y
yum install wget -y
```

For Windows, use batch commands or PowerShell syntax.

#### 6. Specify Storage

Configure the volumes (disks) attached to your instance:

**[[Amazon EBS]]** (Elastic Block Store):

- Persistent block storage
- Independent of instance lifecycle
- Can change size or type without downtime
- Multiple volume types for different performance needs

**[[EC2 Instance Store]]**:

- Temporary storage physically attached to host
- High performance but data lost if instance stops
- Good for buffers, caches, temporary data

**[[Amazon EFS]]** (Elastic File System):

- Managed NFS file system
- Shared across multiple instances
- Scales automatically

**[[Amazon S3]]**:

- Object storage (not block storage)
- For files, backups, archives
- Access via API, not mounted as disk

#### 7. Add Tags

**[[Tags]]** are key-value pairs that add metadata to resources.

**Example tags**:

- `Name: Web Server 01`
- `Environment: Production`
- `Owner: Engineering Team`
- `Cost Center: Marketing`

**Benefits**:

- Organize resources
- Track costs by project or team
- Search and filter instances
- Automate management tasks

**Important**: Tag keys are case-sensitive. `Name` and `name` are different tags.

#### 8. Configure [[Security Group]] Settings

Security groups act as **virtual firewalls** controlling network traffic.

**How they work**:

- Define rules allowing specific traffic
- Rules specify: protocol (TCP/UDP), port, and source
- Multiple security groups can be attached to one instance
- Rules evaluated together (most permissive wins)
- Changes apply immediately to associated instances

**Example rule**: Allow SSH (port 22) from "My IP" only

- Protocol: TCP
- Port: 22
- Source: Your current IP address

**Default behavior**: All outbound traffic allowed, all inbound traffic blocked unless explicitly permitted.

#### 9. Create or Select [[Key Pair]]

**[[Key pairs]]** use public-key cryptography for secure login:

- **Public key** - Stored on the instance
- **Private key** - You download and keep secure (only chance to download!)

**For Windows**: Use private key to decrypt administrator password, then connect via [[RDP]] (Remote Desktop Protocol)

**For Linux**: Use private key to establish [[SSH]] connection

**Critical**: Store your private key securely. If lost, you cannot access the instance.

## Managing EC2 Instances

### Instance Lifecycle States

Understanding the **[[EC2 instance lifecycle]]** helps manage instances effectively:

- **Pending** - Instance is starting up, booting, deploying
- **Running** - Instance is fully operational and accessible
- **Rebooting** - Restarting (stays on same host, keeps IP and data)
- **Stopping** - Transition state before stopped (EBS-backed only)
- **Stopped** - Instance is shut down (no compute charges, but storage charges apply)
- **Shutting down** - Transition before termination
- **Terminated** - Instance is permanently deleted (brief visibility in console, then gone)

**Key insight**: Stopped instances can be restarted but may move to different physical hosts. Terminated instances cannot be recovered.

### IP Address Management

**Public IP addresses**:

- Assigned from AWS pool
- Changes when instance stops/starts
- Released back to pool when not in use

**[[Elastic IP addresses]]**:

- Static public IPs you can keep
- Remains with your account until released
- Can be reassociated to different instances
- Limited to 5 per Region (soft limit, can request increase)

**When to use Elastic IPs**: When you need a consistent public IP address (e.g., for DNS records, whitelisting).

### Instance Metadata

**[[EC2 instance metadata]]** provides information about the running instance, accessible from within the instance:

- Access URL: `http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/`
- Available information: public/private IPs, instance ID, security groups, Region, Availability Zone
- User data accessible at: `http://169.254.169.254/latest/user-data`

**Use cases**: Configuration scripts can read metadata to dynamically configure applications based on their environment.

### Monitoring with CloudWatch

**[[Amazon CloudWatch]]** monitors EC2 instances automatically:

- **Basic monitoring** (default): 5-minute intervals, free
- **Detailed monitoring** (optional): 1-minute intervals, additional cost
- **Available metrics**: CPU utilization, disk I/O, network traffic
- **Historical data**: Retained for 15 months

**Note**: RAM metrics require additional configuration (not provided by default).

## Launching Instances Programmatically

### Using the [[AWS CLI]]

You can launch instances using command-line tools:

```bash
aws ec2 run-instances \
  --image-id ami-1a2b3c4d \
  --count 1 \
  --instance-type c3.large \
  --key-name MyKeyPair \
  --security-groups MySecurityGroup \
  --region us-east-1
```

**Benefits**:

- Automation and scripting
- Integration with CI/CD pipelines
- Consistent, repeatable deployments

**Alternative approaches**: Use [[AWS SDKs]] in various programming languages (Python, Java, Node.js, etc.) for deeper integration.

# EC2 Cost Optimization

## Understanding EC2 Pricing Models

AWS offers multiple pricing models to optimize costs:

### [[On-Demand Instances]]

**Characteristics**:

- Pay by the hour or second (Linux/Ubuntu only)
- No upfront commitment
- No long-term contract

**Best for**:

- Short-term, irregular workloads
- Testing and development
- Applications with unpredictable traffic
- First-time workloads

**AWS Free Tier eligible**: Yes

### [[Reserved Instances]]

**Characteristics**:

- 1-year or 3-year commitment
- Significant discount (up to 75% vs On-Demand)
- Fixed pricing for the term

**Best for**:

- Steady-state workloads
- Predictable usage patterns
- Long-running applications (databases, always-on services)

**Example**: A database server running 24/7 for multiple years

### [[Scheduled Reserved Instances]]

**Characteristics**:

- Reserve capacity for specific time windows
- Daily, weekly, or monthly patterns
- 1-year term
- Pay for scheduled time whether used or not

**Best for**:

- Predictable periodic workloads
- Batch processing with known schedules

### [[Spot Instances]]

**Characteristics**:

- Bid on unused EC2 capacity
- Up to 90% discount vs On-Demand
- Can be interrupted with 2-minute warning
- Price fluctuates based on supply and demand

**Best for**:

- Fault-tolerant applications
- Flexible start/end times
- Big data processing
- CI/CD environments
- Applications that save state frequently

**Not suitable for**: Applications requiring guaranteed availability

### [[Dedicated Hosts]]

**Characteristics**:

- Physical server dedicated to your use
- Full visibility and control over physical resources
- Bring your own licenses (per-socket, per-core, per-VM)

**Best for**:

- Regulatory requirements
- Compliance needs
- Existing software licenses

### [[Dedicated Instances]]

**Characteristics**:

- Run in VPC on hardware dedicated to single customer
- Physically isolated from other AWS accounts
- May share hardware with other instances in same account

**Difference from Dedicated Hosts**: Less visibility into physical infrastructure, but still isolated at hardware level.

## The Four Pillars of Cost Optimization

### Pillar 1: Right-Sizing

**[[Right-sizing]]** means choosing the smallest instance that meets performance requirements.

**Approach**:

1. Start with an educated guess
2. Monitor CPU, RAM, storage, and network utilization using [[Amazon CloudWatch]]
3. Identify over-provisioned instances
4. Downsize where possible
5. Test to ensure performance requirements still met

**Example**: If monitoring shows a `t3.large` instance consistently uses only 20% CPU and 30% RAM, consider downsizing to `t3.medium` - you'll cut costs in half while maintaining performance.

**Tools**: Use CloudWatch metrics and custom metrics to gather detailed utilization data.

### Pillar 2: Increase Elasticity

**[[Elasticity]]** means using resources only when needed.

**Strategies**:

**For non-production environments**:

- Stop instances outside business hours
- Example: Development servers running 8 AM - 6 PM (10 hours) vs 24 hours = 58% cost reduction

**For production workloads**:

- Use [[Auto Scaling]] to match capacity to demand
- Scale horizontally (more instances) during peaks
- Scale down during quiet periods

**Target**: 20-30% of instances as On-Demand or Spot for maximum elasticity

**Analogy**: Like turning off lights when leaving a room - you only pay for electricity when lights are on.

### Pillar 3: Optimal Pricing Model

Combine multiple pricing models based on workload patterns:

**Recommended mix**:

- **Reserved Instances**: Baseline capacity (always-running workloads)
- **On-Demand Instances**: Variable capacity beyond baseline
- **Spot Instances**: Flexible, interruptible workloads

**Alternative architectures**: Consider [[AWS Lambda]] for event-driven workloads - no charges when code isn't running.

### Pillar 4: Optimize Storage Choices

**Strategies**:

1. **Resize volumes**: If you provisioned 500 GB but only use 20 GB, shrink the volume
2. **Choose appropriate volume types**:
    - [[EBS gp2]] (General Purpose SSD): Default, balanced
    - [[EBS st1]] (Throughput Optimized HDD): Half the cost, good for sequential access
3. **Delete unused snapshots**: Review and remove old backups
4. **Use appropriate storage service**:
    - EBS for block storage (databases)
    - [[Amazon S3]] for object storage (files, backups) - often cheaper
    - Implement lifecycle policies to move data to cheaper tiers

## Continuous Improvement

Cost optimization is ongoing, not one-time:

**Key practices**:

1. **Implement tagging**: Tag resources by project, team, environment
2. **Use [[AWS Cost Explorer]]**: Visualize spending patterns over time
3. **Review regularly**: Monthly cost reviews identify optimization opportunities
4. **Leverage [[AWS Trusted Advisor]]**: Automated recommendations for cost savings
5. **Assign ownership**: Designate individuals or teams responsible for cost optimization
6. **Architect for cost**: Make cost a design consideration from the start

# Container Services

## Understanding Containers

**[[Containers]]** provide operating system virtualization, running applications and dependencies in isolated processes.

### Key Characteristics

- **Smaller than VMs**: Don't include entire OS, share host OS kernel
- **Fast startup**: Launch in milliseconds vs minutes for VMs
- **Resource efficient**: Multiple containers share single OS
- **Consistent**: Same environment everywhere (development, testing, production)
- **Portable**: Run on laptops, VMs, EC2 instances, bare metal

### What Containers Include

Each container packages:

- Application code
- Runtime environment
- System libraries
- Dependencies
- Configuration files

**What they DON'T include**: Full operating system (they share the host OS kernel)


## Containers vs Virtual Machines

### Virtual Machine Approach

**Three separate EC2 instances**, each running:

- Own guest operating system
- One application per VM
- Complete isolation

**Resource usage**: Three full operating systems consuming memory and storage

### Container Approach

**One EC2 instance** running:

- Single guest operating system
- Docker engine
- Three containers (one per application)

**Resource usage**: One operating system supporting all three applications

**Key advantage**: Dramatically better resource utilization - one large EC2 instance running hundreds of containers vs hundreds of EC2 instances each running one application.


## Docker Overview

**[[Docker]]** is a software platform for building, shipping, and running containers.

### What Docker Provides

- **Container runtime**: Execute and manage containers
- **Simple commands**: build, start, stop containers
- **Image management**: Create and distribute container images
- **Portability**: Same container runs anywhere Docker is installed

### When to Use Docker

- Standardize environments across development, testing, production
- Reduce conflicts between language versions or dependencies
- Enable microservices architectures
- Improve portability of data processing workloads
- Efficiently utilize server resources

### Docker Components

- **[[Docker image]]**: Template defining container contents
- **[[Docker container]]**: Running instance of an image
- **[[Docker engine]]**: Software managing container lifecycle

## Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service)

### Why Use ECS?

While you could manually install Docker on EC2 instances, [[Amazon ECS]] simplifies container management at scale.

### Core Concepts

**[[Task Definition]]**:

- JSON/text file describing your container configuration
- Specifies: which images, how many containers (1-10), ports, data volumes
- Think of it as a blueprint for your application

**[[ECS Task]]**:

- Running instantiation of a task definition
- One task might run 1-10 containers (as defined in task definition)
- You specify how many tasks to run

**[[ECS Cluster]]**:

- Logical grouping of EC2 instances (with EC2 launch type)
- Each instance runs the [[ECS container agent]]
- ECS scheduler places tasks across cluster based on resource availability

### Key Capabilities

- Launch tens of thousands of containers in seconds
- Monitor container deployment status
- Manage cluster state
- Schedule containers using built-in or third-party schedulers
- Support for Spot and Reserved Instances

## ECS Cluster Options

When creating an ECS cluster, choose from three options:

### 1. Networking Only Cluster ([[AWS Fargate]])

- **AWS manages infrastructure completely**
- You specify: container image, CPU/memory requirements, networking, IAM policies
- You DON'T manage: EC2 instances, scaling, cluster optimization
- **Best for**: Focus on application, not infrastructure

### 2. EC2 Linux + Networking

- **You manage EC2 instances**
- Choose: instance types, On-Demand vs Spot, scaling policies
- **More control** over underlying infrastructure
- ECS tracks resources and finds optimal placement

### 3. EC2 Windows + Networking

- Same as EC2 Linux but for Windows containers

**Decision factor**: Fargate removes infrastructure management burden; EC2 launch type provides more control and potentially lower costs for large, consistent workloads.

## Kubernetes and Amazon EKS

### What is [[Kubernetes]]?

**Kubernetes** (K8s) is open-source container orchestration software.

**Key features**:

- Works with multiple container technologies (not just Docker)
- Manages clusters of compute nodes
- Runs containers in logical groups called [[pods]]
- Provides service discovery and load balancing
- Portable across cloud and on-premises

### Kubernetes Architecture

- **[[Cluster]]**: Group of compute instances (nodes)
- **[[Node]]**: Individual compute instance running containers
- **[[Pod]]**: Smallest deployable unit (one or more containers)
- **Service**: Stable network endpoint for accessing pods

**Benefits**: Deploy anywhere using same tooling - on-premises, AWS, multi-cloud.

### Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)

**[[Amazon EKS]]** is a managed Kubernetes service.

**What EKS manages**:

- Kubernetes control plane
- Availability and scalability of control plane nodes
- Automatic detection and replacement of unhealthy control plane nodes
- Patching and updates

**What you manage**:

- Worker nodes (EC2 instances running your containers)
- Deploying applications
- Kubernetes configuration

**Integration**: Works with AWS services (Application Load Balancer, IAM, VPC)

### ECS vs EKS

Both orchestrate Docker containers - why two services?

- **ECS**: AWS-specific, simpler to learn, tighter AWS integration
- **EKS**: Industry-standard Kubernetes, portable across environments, larger ecosystem

**Choose based on**: Team expertise, portability requirements, existing investments.

## Amazon ECR (Elastic Container Registry)

**[[Amazon ECR]]** is a fully managed Docker registry.

### What It Does

- **Store** Docker container images securely
- **Manage** image versions and tags
- **Deploy** images to ECS, EKS, or anywhere

### Key Features

- Integrated with ECS and EKS (specify ECR repository in task definition)
- Compatible with Docker CLI and tools
- HTTPS transfer for security
- Automatic encryption at rest (using S3)
- Fine-grained access control using IAM

**Workflow**: Build image locally → Push to ECR → Deploy to ECS/EKS from ECR

# AWS Lambda

## Understanding Serverless Computing

**[[Serverless Computing]]** doesn't mean "no servers" - it means you don't think about servers.

### What is AWS Lambda?

**[[AWS Lambda]]** is an event-driven, serverless compute service.

**Key concept**: Upload code, configure trigger, Lambda runs code when triggered. You pay only for execution time (billed in 100ms increments).

### The Lambda Function

A **[[Lambda function]]** is your custom code packaged as an AWS resource.

**Components**:

- Your code (Python, Java, Node.js, C#, Go, PowerShell, Ruby)
- Any libraries or dependencies
- Configuration (memory, timeout, permissions)

## Benefits of Lambda

### 1. No Infrastructure Management

- No servers to provision, patch, or manage
- Automatic deployment
- Built-in fault tolerance across multiple Availability Zones
- No maintenance windows

### 2. Language Flexibility

Supports multiple languages without learning new frameworks:

- Use native or third-party libraries
- Leverage existing skills
- Bring your own code

### 3. Automatic Scaling

- Scales automatically from few requests per day to thousands per second
- No capacity planning needed
- Handles variable loads seamlessly

### 4. Cost Efficiency

Pay-per-use pricing:

- No charges when code isn't running
- Billed in 100ms increments
- Free tier: 1 million requests/month

### 5. Orchestration with [[AWS Step Functions]]

Build complex workflows:

- Chain multiple Lambda functions
- Implement error handling
- Create sequential, parallel, or branching logic
- Build long-running processes

## Lambda Event Sources

Lambda functions are triggered by **[[event sources]]**:

### Direct Invocation (Asynchronous)

Services that directly invoke Lambda:

- **[[Amazon S3]]**: Object upload/delete events
- **[[Amazon SNS]]**: Message publication
- **[[Amazon CloudWatch Events]]**: Scheduled or rule-based triggers

### Polling (Lambda pulls events)

Lambda polls these services:

- **[[Amazon SQS]]**: Queue messages
- **[[Amazon DynamoDB]]**: Stream records
- **[[Amazon Kinesis]]**: Data streams

### Synchronous Invocation

Direct calls to Lambda:

- **[[Application Load Balancer]]**: HTTP(S) requests
- **[[Amazon API Gateway]]**: REST API calls
- **AWS SDK/CLI**: Manual invocation

### Custom Applications

Invoke Lambda directly from:

- Mobile apps
- Web applications
- IoT devices

## Configuring Lambda Functions

### Basic Configuration

1. **Function name**: Identifier for your function
2. **Runtime**: Language and version (e.g., Python 3.11, Node.js 18)
3. **Execution role**: [[IAM role]] granting permissions to AWS services

### Detailed Configuration

**Trigger**: Define what events invoke the function

**Code**:

- Use inline code editor for simple functions
- Upload .zip file for complex functions with dependencies
- Use container images (up to 10 GB) for large dependencies

**Memory allocation**: 128 MB to 10,240 MB

- More memory = more CPU power
- Affects pricing

**Timeout**: 1 second to 15 minutes maximum

- Function terminated if timeout exceeded

**Environment variables**: Pass configuration without hardcoding

**VPC settings**: Optionally run in specific VPC to access private resources

**[[Lambda layers]]**: Reusable code packages (libraries, dependencies)

- Share code between functions
- Keep deployment packages small
- Maximum 5 layers per function

## Lambda Use Cases

### Example 1: Scheduled Start/Stop EC2 Instances

**Problem**: Reduce costs by stopping EC2 instances outside business hours

**Solution**:

1. CloudWatch Event scheduled for 10 PM → Triggers Lambda → Stops EC2 instances
2. CloudWatch Event scheduled for 5 AM → Triggers Lambda → Starts EC2 instances

**Components**:

- Two CloudWatch Events (schedules)
- Two Lambda functions (start and stop logic)
- IAM role with EC2 permissions

### Example 2: Automatic Thumbnail Generation

**Problem**: Create thumbnails for images uploaded to S3

**Solution**:

1. User uploads image to S3 source bucket
2. S3 object-created event triggers Lambda
3. Lambda reads image from source bucket
4. Lambda creates thumbnail using image processing library
5. Lambda saves thumbnail to target bucket

**Components**:

- S3 source and target buckets
- Lambda function with image processing code
- IAM role with S3 read/write permissions

## Lambda Limitations

Understanding **[[Lambda quotas]]** helps avoid deployment issues:

### Compute Limits

- **Memory**: 128 MB to 10,240 MB
- **Timeout**: 1 second to 15 minutes (hard limit)
- **Concurrent executions**: 1,000 per Region (soft limit)

### Package Limits

- **Deployment package** (.zip): 250 MB
- **Container image**: 10 GB
- **[[Lambda layers]]**: Up to 5 per function

### Workarounds

- Use layers to share code and reduce package size
- Use container images for larger dependencies
- Request limit increases for soft limits

**Hard limits** cannot be increased. **Soft limits** can potentially be raised through support tickets with justification.

2. **Architecture Decision**: When would you choose AWS Lambda over Amazon EC2 for running an application? Provide three specific scenarios and explain why Lambda is the better choice.
    
3. **Container Selection**: Compare and contrast Amazon ECS and Amazon EKS. What factors would influence your decision to use one over the other?
    
4. **Right-Sizing Exercise**: An EC2 instance consistently shows 15% CPU utilization and 25% memory usage. What steps would you take to optimize costs while maintaining performance?
    
5. **Security Configuration**: Explain how IAM roles, security groups, and key pairs work together to secure an EC2 instance. What is the purpose of each, and why shouldn't you ever store AWS credentials on an EC2 instance?
    
6. **Lifecycle Management**: Describe the lifecycle of an EC2 instance from launch to termination. What happens to data in EBS volumes vs Instance Store volumes when an instance is stopped?
    
7. **Lambda Limitations**: You need to run a data processing job that typically takes 20 minutes. Can you use AWS Lambda? If not, what alternatives would you suggest?
    
8. **Cost Optimization Strategy**: You're running 50 EC2 instances - 30 run 24/7 for production, 15 run only during business hours for development, and 5 run batch jobs that can be interrupted. Design an optimal pricing strategy using multiple EC2 pricing models.
    
9. **Container vs VM**: Explain to a non-technical stakeholder why containers might be more efficient than virtual machines for microservices architecture.
    
10. **Elastic Beanstalk Use Case**: When would Elastic Beanstalk be the right choice over managing EC2 instances directly? When would you choose EC2 instead?
