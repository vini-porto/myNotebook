# AWS Global Infrastructure

**[[AWS Global Infrastructure]]**: Designed and built to deliver a flexible, reliable, scalable, and secure cloud computing environment with high-quality global network performance.

**Core principle**: The infrastructure provides the foundation for all AWS services and customer workloads.

# AWS Regions

## What is an AWS Region?

**[[AWS Region]]**: A physical geographical location with one or more [[Availability Zones]].

**Current scale**: AWS has 22 Regions worldwide (as of the lecture date).

**Infrastructure hierarchy**: AWS Cloud infrastructure is built around Regions, which contain Availability Zones, which in turn consist of one or more [[Data Centers]].

## Region Isolation and Data Residency

**Key characteristics**:

- Each Region is completely independent
- Resources in one Region are **not automatically replicated** to other Regions
- Regions are isolated from one another for **[[Fault Tolerance]]** and stability

**[[Data Residency]]**: When you store data in a specific Region, it is **not replicated outside that Region** unless you explicitly configure it.

**Your responsibility**: You must replicate data across Regions if your business needs require it.

## Region Availability

**Default-enabled Regions**: Regions introduced before March 20, 2019 are enabled by default.

**[[Opt-in Regions]]**: Regions introduced after March 20, 2019 are disabled by default.

**Examples of opt-in Regions**:

- Asia Pacific (Hong Kong)
- Middle East (Bahrain)

**Enabling Regions**: Use the [[AWS Management Console]] to enable or disable Regions as needed.

# Selecting a Region

When choosing the optimal Region(s) for your workloads, consider these factors:

## 1. Data Governance and Legal Requirements

**[[Data Governance]]**: Local laws might require certain information be kept within geographical boundaries.

**[[Compliance Requirements]]**: Laws may restrict where you can offer content or services.

**Example**: [[European Union Data Protection Directive]] requires certain data to remain within EU boundaries.

**Principle**: Always verify legal and regulatory requirements before selecting a Region.

## 2. Latency (Proximity to Users)

**Goal**: Run applications and store data in a Region as close as possible to users and systems that access them.

**Benefit**: Reduces **[[Latency]]**—the delay between request and response.

**Testing tool**: [[CloudPing]] is a website to test latency between your location and all AWS Regions.

**Best practice**: Choose Regions closest to your user base for optimal performance.

## 3. Service Availability

**Consideration**: Some AWS services and features are not available in all Regions.

**Action**: Verify that the services you need are available in your chosen Region before deployment.

## 4. Cost Variation

**[[Regional Pricing]]**: The cost of running services varies by Region.

**Example comparison** (On-Demand t3.medium [[Amazon EC2]] Linux instance):

- **US East (Ohio)**: $0.0416 per hour
- **Asia Pacific (Tokyo)**: $0.0544 per hour

**30% price difference** for the same resource in different Regions.

**Strategy**: Balance cost savings with performance and compliance requirements.

# Availability Zones

## What is an Availability Zone?

**[[Availability Zone]]** (AZ): Multiple isolated locations within each AWS Region.

**Purpose**: Operate applications and databases that are more highly available, fault-tolerant, and scalable than single data center deployments.

## Availability Zone Characteristics

**Physical composition**:

- Each AZ can include multiple data centers (typically **three**)
- At full scale, hundreds of thousands of servers
- Fully isolated partitions of AWS Global Infrastructure

**Infrastructure independence**:

- Own **power infrastructure**
- Physically separated by **many kilometers** from other AZs
- All AZs within **100 km** of each other in the same Region

**Connectivity between AZs**:

- Interconnected with **high-bandwidth, low-latency networking**
- Fully redundant, dedicated fiber connections
- Provides **high-throughput** between AZs
- Enables **[[Synchronous Replication]]** between Availability Zones

## Building Highly Available Applications

**[[High Availability]]**: When applications are partitioned across Availability Zones, companies are better isolated and protected from:

- Lightning strikes
- Tornadoes
- Earthquakes
- Power failures
- Natural disasters
- Infrastructure failures

**Your responsibility**:

- Select which Availability Zones your systems will reside in
- Systems can span multiple Availability Zones

**[[AWS Recommendation]]**: Replicate across Availability Zones for **[[Resiliency]]**.

**Design principle**: Design systems to survive the temporary or prolonged failure of an Availability Zone if a disaster occurs.

# AWS Data Centers

## Foundation of AWS Infrastructure

**[[Data Centers]]**: The physical locations where actual data resides and servers operate.

**Customer control**: Customers do **not** specify a data center for resource deployment—Availability Zone is the most granular level of specification.

**Scale**: Amazon operates state-of-the-art, highly available data centers worldwide.

## Data Center Design and Operations

**Risk mitigation**: Each location is carefully evaluated to mitigate environmental risk.

**[[Redundant Design]]**: Data centers anticipate and tolerate failure while maintaining service levels.

**Key operational principles**:

**Availability**: Critical system components are backed up across multiple Availability Zones.

**Capacity management**: AWS continuously monitors service usage to deploy infrastructure supporting availability commitments.

**Security**:

- Data center locations are **not disclosed**
- All access to them is **restricted**

**Failure recovery**: Automated processes move data traffic away from affected areas in case of failure.

## Network Equipment

**Custom infrastructure**: AWS uses custom network equipment sourced from multiple [[Original Device Manufacturers]] (ODMs).

**[[ODM Model]]**: ODMs design and manufacture products based on specifications from AWS. AWS then rebrands the products for deployment.

**Benefit**: Custom-designed hardware optimized for AWS workloads and requirements.

# Points of Presence

## Edge Locations and Content Delivery

**[[Points of Presence]]**: Locations in major cities around the world for content delivery and DNS services.

**Primary services using Points of Presence**:

- [[Amazon CloudFront]] - Content Delivery Network (CDN)
- [[Amazon Route 53]] - Domain Name System (DNS) service
- [[AWS Shield]] - DDoS protection
- [[AWS WAF]] - Web Application Firewall

## How Points of Presence Work

**[[Amazon CloudFront]]**: CDN used to distribute content to end users to reduce latency.

**[[Amazon Route 53]]**: DNS service that translates domain names to IP addresses.

**Automatic routing**: Requests to these services are routed to the **nearest edge location** automatically to lower latency.

**Continuous optimization**: By continuously measuring internet connectivity, performance, and computing, Points of Presence find the best way to route requests.

**Result**: Better **near real-time user experience**.

## Regional Edge Caches

**[[Regional Edge Caches]]**: Used by default with Amazon CloudFront.

**Purpose**: For content that is not accessed frequently enough to remain in an edge location.

**Function**:

- Absorb less-frequently accessed content
- Provide an alternative to fetching content from the origin server
- Sit between edge locations and origin servers

**Benefit**: Improved performance without requiring content to travel all the way back to the origin.

# AWS Infrastructure Features

## Practical Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Multi-Region Architecture Design

Your company is launching a video streaming service. Users are in North America (60%), Europe (30%), and Asia (10%). Design a multi-Region architecture explaining:

- Which Regions you'd select and why
- How you'd handle content delivery
- Data replication strategy
- Compliance considerations

### Scenario 2: High Availability Design

Design a highly available web application architecture that can survive:

- Single server failure
- Availability Zone failure
- Regional disaster

Specify which AWS services you'd use and how you'd configure them across AZs and Regions.

### Scenario 3: Service Selection

Choose the appropriate AWS service for each use case: a) Host a WordPress blog with minimal management b) Store 500TB of security camera footage for 7 years c) Run a containerized microservices application d) Provide user authentication for a mobile app e) Cache website content closer to global users f) Run Python code in response to S3 upload events

### Scenario 4: Cost Optimization Across Regions

You're running identical EC2 workloads in 3 Regions:

- US East (Ohio): $0.0416/hour
- Europe (Frankfurt): $0.0504/hour
- Asia Pacific (Tokyo): $0.0544/hour

Each workload runs 24/7 (8,760 hours/year) on 10 instances. Calculate annual costs for each Region and total potential savings if you consolidated to Ohio (assuming latency and compliance allow).

### Scenario 5: Disaster Recovery Planning

Your company's primary infrastructure is in US East (N. Virginia). Design a disaster recovery strategy that:

- Uses multiple Availability Zones
- Has backup in another Region
- Includes database replication
- Maintains compliance with data residency

Specify which AWS services you'd use and the architecture pattern (pilot light, warm standby, or active-active).
