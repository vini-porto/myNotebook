# What is AWS Cloud Security

**[[AWS Security]]**: Security is the highest priority at Amazon Web Services.

**Core mission**: AWS delivers a scalable cloud computing environment designed for high availability and dependability while providing tools to run a wide range of applications.

**Critical objectives**:

- Protect **[[Confidentiality]]** of systems and data
- Protect **[[Integrity]]** of systems and data
- Protect **[[Availability]]** of systems and data
- Maintain customer trust and confidence

> [!NOTE] **Dual approach**:
> AWS security includes both controls in the AWS environment and products/features customers can use to meet their security objectives.

# AWS Shared Responsibility Model

## Overview

**[[AWS Shared Responsibility Model]]**: Security and compliance are a shared responsibility between AWS and the customer.

**Purpose**:

- Help relieve the customer's operational burden
- Provide flexibility and customer control
- Enable deployment of customer solutions on AWS

> [!NOTE] **Key distinction**: 
> Security "**of**" the cloud vs. security "**in**" the cloud.

**Principle**: The customer remains responsible for some aspects of overall security despite AWS managing much of the infrastructure.

# AWS Responsibility: Security OF the Cloud

**[[Security of the Cloud]]**: AWS operates, manages, and controls components from the software virtualization layer down to the physical security of facilities.

**What AWS protects**: The infrastructure that runs all services offered in the AWS Cloud.

**Infrastructure components**:

- Hardware
- Software
- Networking
- Facilities that run AWS Cloud services

# Physical Infrastructure

**[[Physical Security of Data Centers]]**:

- Controlled, need-based access
- Located in nondescript facilities
- 24/7 security guards
- Two-factor authentication
- Access logging and review
- Video surveillance
- Disk degaussing and destruction

## Hardware Infrastructure

**[[Hardware Infrastructure]]**: Servers, storage devices, and other appliances that AWS relies on.

**Management**: AWS maintains and upgrades all physical hardware.

## Software Infrastructure

**[[Software Infrastructure]]**: Hosts operating systems, service applications, and virtualization software.

**Layer**: From bare metal host operating system and [[Hypervisor]] virtualization layer upward.

## Network Infrastructure

**[[Network Infrastructure]]**: Routers, switches, load balancers, firewalls, and cabling.

**Monitoring**:

- Continuously monitors network at external boundaries
- Secures access points
- Provides redundant infrastructure
- Implements intrusion detection

## Global Infrastructure

AWS is responsible for protecting the global infrastructure including:

- [[AWS Regions]]
- [[Availability Zones]]
- [[Edge Locations]]

**Verification**: Third-party auditors verify AWS compliance with computer security standards and regulations.

**Priority**: Protecting this infrastructure is the top priority for AWS.

# Customer Responsibility: Security IN the Cloud

**[[Security in the Cloud]]**: Customers are responsible for security of everything they put in the cloud.

**What customers control**: What is implemented using AWS services and applications connected to AWS.

**Variability**: Security steps depend on:

- Services used
- Complexity of the system

## Customer Security Tasks

Customers are responsible for:

- Selecting and securing instance operating systems
- Securing applications launched on AWS resources
- [[Security Group]] configurations
- Firewall configurations
- Network configurations
- Secure account management

## Critical Content Security Requirements

Customers maintain complete control over their content and are responsible for:

**Content decisions**:

- What content to store on AWS
- Which AWS services are used with the content
- In what country content is stored
- Format and structure of content
- Whether content is masked, anonymized, or encrypted

**[[Access Control]]**:

- Who has access to content
- How access rights are granted
- How access rights are managed
- How access rights are revoked

**Retention of control**: Customers choose what security to implement for their own data, environment, applications, IAM configurations, and operating systems.

# Service Characteristics and Security Responsibility

## Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

**[[IaaS Security Model]]**: Services provide basic building blocks for cloud IT.

**Includes**: Configurable networking, computers (virtual or dedicated hardware), and data storage space.

**Customer control**: Highest level of flexibility and management control over IT resources.

**Most similar to**: Existing on-premises computing resources.

**Example: Amazon EC2**:

- Customers manage guest operating system (including updates and security patches)
- Customers manage application software installed on instances
- Customers configure security groups

**Responsibility**: Customer performs all necessary security configuration and management tasks.

## Platform as a Service (PaaS)

**[[PaaS Security Model]]**: Services remove the need to manage underlying infrastructure.

**Focus**: Customers deploy and manage applications only.

**No need to manage**:

- Hardware
- Operating systems
- Resource procurement
- Capacity planning
- Software maintenance
- Patching

**Examples: AWS Lambda and Amazon RDS**:

- AWS operates the infrastructure layer
- AWS manages operating system
- AWS manages platforms
- Customers access endpoints to store and retrieve data

**Customer responsibilities**:

- Managing their data
- Classifying their assets
- Applying appropriate permissions

**AWS handles**:

- Operating system patching
- Database patching
- Firewall configuration
- Disaster recovery

**Characterization**: More like [[Managed Services]] with AWS handling a larger portion of security requirements.

## Software as a Service (SaaS)

**[[SaaS Security Model]]**: Services provide centrally hosted software.

**Access methods**: Web browser, mobile app, or API.

**Licensing**: Typically subscription or pay-as-you-go.

**Customer management**: Customers do not manage infrastructure supporting the service.

**AWS SaaS examples**:

**[[AWS Trusted Advisor]]**:

- Online tool analyzing AWS environment
- Provides real-time guidance and recommendations
- Helps provision resources following AWS best practices
- Part of AWS Support plan
- Free features for all accounts
- Full features for Business and Enterprise Support customers

**[[AWS Shield]]**:

- Managed [[DDoS Protection]] service
- Safeguards applications running on AWS
- Always-on detection
- Automatic inline mitigations
- Minimizes application downtime and latency
- No need to engage AWS Support for basic protection
- Advanced version available to all customers
- DDoS Response Team available with Enterprise or Business Support

**[[Amazon Chime]]**:

- Communications service
- Meet, chat, and place business calls
- Single application for all communication
- Pay-as-you-go pricing
- No upfront fees, commitments, or long-term contracts

## Shared Responsibility Model Activity

## Scenario Analysis

**Deployment**: Customer uses Amazon S3 to store data, configured a VPC, and runs EC2 instance and Oracle database in the VPC.

**Questions**: Who is responsible—AWS or the customer?

## Answers

**1. OS upgrades and patches on EC2 instance**

- **Answer**: Customer
- Customer manages guest OS including security patches

**2. Physical security of data center**

- **Answer**: AWS
- Part of infrastructure AWS manages

**3. Virtualization infrastructure**

- **Answer**: AWS
- Hypervisor layer is AWS responsibility

**4. EC2 security group settings**

- **Answer**: Customer
- Customer configures AWS firewalls

**5. Configuration of applications on EC2**

- **Answer**: Customer
- Customer manages all application software

**6. Oracle upgrades/patches if running as Amazon RDS**

- **Answer**: AWS
- RDS is managed service—AWS handles patching

**7. Oracle upgrades/patches if running on EC2**

- **Answer**: Customer
- Customer manages all software on EC2 instances

**8. S3 bucket access configuration**

- **Answer**: Customer
- Customer controls access to their content

# Key Insight: RDS vs. EC2 Database

**Database on EC2**: Customer applies Oracle software upgrades and patches.

**Database on RDS**: AWS applies Oracle software upgrades and patches.

**Reason**: Amazon RDS is a [[Managed Database]] offering—AWS handles time-consuming database administration tasks:

- Provisioning
- Backups
- Software patching
- Monitoring
- Hardware scaling

# AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)

## What is IAM?

**[[AWS IAM]]**: Allows you to control access to compute, storage, database, and application services in the AWS Cloud.

**Purpose**:

- Handle **[[Authentication]]** (proving identity)
- Specify and enforce **[[Authorization]]** policies (what actions are permitted)

**Centralized management**: Tool for managing access to launching, configuring, managing, and terminating resources in your AWS account.

## Granular Control

**[[Granular Access Control]]**: Ability to specify exactly which API calls users are authorized to make to each service.

**Universal access**: Whether using AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or AWS SDKs, every call to an AWS service is an API call.

**What IAM manages**:

- Which resources can be accessed
- By whom
- How resources can be accessed

**Example scenarios**:

- Some users: Full access to EC2, S3, DynamoDB, Redshift, and other services
- Other users: Read-only access to only a few S3 buckets
- Other users: Administer only specific EC2 instances
- Other users: Access only account billing information

**Cost**: IAM is a feature of your AWS account offered at **no additional charge**.

# IAM: Essential Components

Understanding the four IAM components is critical for securing your AWS account:

## IAM User

**[[IAM User]]**: A person or application defined in an AWS account that must make API calls to AWS products.

**Requirements**:

- Unique name within the AWS account (no spaces)
- Set of security credentials not shared with other users
- Credentials different from AWS account root user credentials
- Defined in one and only one AWS account

## IAM Group

**[[IAM Group]]**: A collection of IAM users.

**Purpose**: Simplify specifying and managing permissions for multiple users.

**Benefit**: Assign permissions to groups rather than individual users.

## IAM Policy

**[[IAM Policy]]**: A document that defines permissions to determine what users can do in the AWS account.

**Typically grants**: Access to specific resources and specifies what users can do with those resources.

**Can also**: Explicitly deny access.

## IAM Role

**[[IAM Role]]**: A tool for granting temporary access to specific AWS resources in an AWS account.

**Key characteristic**: Not uniquely associated with one person—assumable by anyone who needs it.

# Authentication: Proving Identity

**[[Authentication]]**: The process of proving identity.

**Analogy**: Like presenting identification at airport security to prove who you are before entering a restricted area.

**Concept**: A user or system must first prove their identity before gaining access to AWS resources.

## Types of Access

When defining an IAM user, select which type of access the user is permitted:

**1. [[Programmatic Access]]**:

- Requires **[[Access Key ID]]** and **[[Secret Access Key]]**
- Used when making AWS API calls via:
    - AWS CLI
    - AWS SDK
    - Other development tools

**2. [[AWS Management Console Access]]**:

- User fills in browser login fields:
    - 12-digit account ID or account alias
    - IAM user name
    - Password
    - MFA authentication code (if enabled)

**Flexibility**: Can assign programmatic access only, console access only, or both.

# Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

**[[Multi-Factor Authentication]]** (MFA): Additional security layer beyond username and password.

**Requirement**: Users and systems must provide an MFA token **in addition to** regular sign-in credentials before accessing AWS services.

**Strong recommendation**: Enable MFA for increased security.

## MFA Token Options

**[[Virtual MFA Applications]]**:

- Google Authenticator
- Authy 2-Factor Authentication

**[[U2F Security Key]]**: Physical USB device.

**[[Hardware MFA Device]]**: Key fob or display card.

# Authorization: What Actions Are Permitted

**Authorization:** The process of determining what permissions a user, service, or application should be granted.

**Process flow**: After a user is authenticated, they must be authorized to access AWS services.

## Default Permissions

**Default state**: IAM users have **no permissions** to access any resources or data in an AWS account by default.

**Requirement**: Must explicitly grant permissions to a user, group, or role by creating a policy.

**[[Policy Document]]**: Written in [[JSON]] (JavaScript Object Notation) format.

**Policy content**: Lists permissions that allow or deny access to resources in the AWS account.

# IAM Authorization Principles

## How Permissions Work

**No default permissions**: All actions in the account are denied by default (**[[Implicit Deny]]**) unless explicitly allowed.

**Explicit allow**: Actions must be explicitly allowed to be permitted.

**[[Explicit Deny]]**: Any actions explicitly denied are **always denied** (takes precedence over allow).

## Principle of Least Privilege

**[[Principle of Least Privilege]]**: Important security concept—grant only the minimal user privileges needed based on user requirements.

**Best practice process**:

1. Determine what users need to do
2. Craft policies allowing users to perform only those tasks
3. Start with minimum set of permissions
4. Grant additional permissions as necessary

**Reasoning**: More secure than starting with broad permissions and later trying to restrict them.

## Global Scope

**Important note**: IAM service configurations are **global**.

**Not Region-specific**: Settings are not defined at an AWS Region level—IAM settings apply across all AWS Regions.

# IAM Policies

## What is an IAM Policy?

**[[IAM Policy]]**: A formal statement of permissions granted to an entity.

**Can be attached to**: Users, groups, roles, or resources.

**Example**: Attach a policy to AWS resources that blocks all requests not coming from an approved IP address range.

**Policy specifies**:

- What actions are allowed
- Which resources to allow actions on
- What effect will be when user requests access

## Policy Evaluation

**Order independence**: The order policies are evaluated has no effect on the outcome.

**Evaluation process**: All policies are evaluated.

**Result**: Request is either allowed or denied.

**Conflict resolution**: When there is a conflict, the most restrictive policy applies.

## Types of IAM Policies

**1. [[Identity-Based Policies]]**: Permissions policies attached to a principal (identity) such as:

- IAM user
- IAM role
- IAM group

**Controls**: What actions that identity can perform, on which resources, and under what conditions.

**Subtypes**:

**[[Managed Policies]]**:

- Standalone identity-based policies
- Can attach to multiple users, groups, and roles in AWS account
- Can be AWS-managed or customer-managed

**[[Inline Policies]]**:

- Policies you create and manage
- Embedded directly into a single user, group, or role
- Strict one-to-one relationship

**2. [[Resource-Based Policies]]**: JSON policy documents attached to a resource (such as S3 bucket).

**Controls**: What actions a specified principal can perform on that resource, and under what conditions.

**Characteristic**: Defined inline only on the resource itself.

# IAM Policy Example

**Format**: IAM policy documents are written in [[JSON]].

**Example policy grants**:

- Access only to specific DynamoDB table
- Access to specific S3 bucket and all objects it contains

**Key element**: **[[Explicit Deny]]** (`"Effect":"Deny"`)

**[[NotResource Element]]**: Ensures users cannot use any other DynamoDB or S3 actions/resources except those specified—even if permissions granted in another policy.

**Precedence rule**: An explicit deny statement takes precedence over an allow statement.

## Resource-Based Policies

### Characteristics

**Attachment**: While identity-based policies attach to users/groups/roles, resource-based policies attach to resources (e.g., S3 buckets).

**Specify**: Who can access the resource and what actions they can perform.

**Definition**: Inline only—define the policy on the resource itself instead of creating separate IAM policy document.

### Examples

**[[S3 Bucket Policy]]**:

- Type of resource-based policy
- Define on S3 bucket via Permissions tab and Bucket Policy button
- JSON-formatted policy document

**[[Amazon S3 ACL]]** (Access Control List):

- Another example of resource-based policy

### Dual Access Methods

**Two ways to grant access** (example: user MaryMajor accessing S3 bucket "photos"):

**Method 1 - Identity-based policy**: IAM policy granting S3 access attached to MaryMajor user.

**Method 2 - Resource-based policy**: S3 bucket policy for "photos" bucket specifies MaryMajor is allowed to list and read objects.

**Important note**: Can define deny statement in bucket policy to restrict access to specific IAM users, even if granted access in separate identity-based policy. **Explicit deny always takes precedence**.

## IAM Permissions Evaluation

**[[IAM Permissions Evaluation]]**: Process IAM uses to determine if permission is allowed.

**Evaluation order**:

1. Check for any applicable **explicit denial** policy
2. If no explicit denial, check for any applicable **explicit allow** policy
3. If neither exists, revert to default: **implicit deny**

**Result**: User permitted to take action only if:

- Requested action is **not explicitly denied**, AND
- Requested action **is explicitly allowed**

**Challenge**: Can be difficult to determine whether access to a resource will be granted when developing IAM policies.

## IAM Groups

### What is an IAM Group?

**[[IAM Group]]**: A collection of IAM users.

**Purpose**: Convenient way to specify permissions for a collection of users, making it easier to manage permissions.

### Example Use Case

**Scenario**: Create IAM group called "Developers"

**Process**:

1. Create "Developers" group
2. Attach IAM policy/policies granting typical developer permissions
3. Add users to Developers group
4. Users automatically inherit group permissions

**Benefits**:

- No need to attach policies directly to users
- New developer: Simply add to Developers group
- Job change: Remove from old group, add to new group

### Important Characteristics

**Many-to-many**:

- A group can contain many users
- A user can belong to multiple groups

**[[No Nesting]]**:

- Groups cannot be nested
- A group can contain only users, not other groups

**No default group**:

- No automatic group including all account users
- Must create group and manually add each user

## IAM Roles

### What is an IAM Role?

**[[IAM Role]]**: An IAM identity you can create in your account with specific permissions.

**Similar to IAM user**: Also an AWS identity with permission policies attached.

**Key difference**:

- Not uniquely associated with one person
- **Assumable by anyone who needs it**
- No standard long-term credentials (password or access keys)
- Provides **[[Temporary Security Credentials]]** for role session

### Use Cases for IAM Roles

**Delegate access to**:

- Users, applications, or services without normal access to AWS resources
- Users needing temporary access to resources they don't usually have
- Users in one AWS account needing access to resources in another account
- Mobile apps using AWS resources (without embedding AWS keys)

**Identity federation**:

- Grant AWS access to users with identities defined outside AWS (e.g., corporate directory)

**Third-party access**:

- Grant access to third parties for auditing your resources

**Essential component**: IAM roles are critical for implementing cloud deployments in all these scenarios.

## Example IAM Role Use

**Scenario**: Developer runs application on EC2 instance requiring S3 bucket access.

**Implementation**:

1. Administrator creates IAM role
2. Administrator attaches role to EC2 instance
3. Role includes **[[Permissions Policy]]**: Grants read-only access to specified S3 bucket
4. Role includes **[[Trust Policy]]**: Allows EC2 instance to assume role and retrieve temporary credentials

**When application runs**:

- Application uses role's temporary credentials to access S3 bucket
- Administrator doesn't need to grant developer permission to access bucket
- Developer never needs to share or manage credentials

**Benefits**:

- Enhanced security (no long-term credentials)
- Automatic credential rotation
- No credential management burden

## Securing a New AWS Account

### AWS Account Root User vs. IAM Access

**[[AWS Account Root User]]**: The first sign-in identity created with an AWS account.

**Characteristics**:

- Complete access to all AWS services and resources
- Accessed by signing in with email address and password used to create account
- Has (and retains) full access to all resources

**AWS strong recommendation**: Do **not** use root user credentials for day-to-day interactions with the account.

**Instead**: Use IAM to create additional users and assign permissions following principle of least privilege.

### Recommended Approach

**For administrator access**:

1. Create IAM user
2. Grant that user full access
3. Use those credentials to interact with account
4. Can revoke or modify permissions by deleting/modifying policies

**For multiple users**:

- Create unique credentials for each user
- Define which user has access to which resources
- **Avoid sharing credentials** between multiple users

**Limited root user usage**: While root user shouldn't be used for routine tasks, some tasks can **only** be accomplished by logging in as root user.

## Securing a New AWS Account: Steps

### Step-by-Step Process

**Step 1**: While logged in as root user:

- Create IAM user for yourself
- Enable AWS Management Console access
- Do not attach permissions yet
- Save IAM user access keys if needed

**Step 2**: Create IAM group:

- Give it a name (e.g., "Full Access")
- Attach IAM policies granting full access to services you'll use
- Add IAM user to the group

**Step 3**: Disable and remove root user access keys (if they exist)

**Step 4**: Enable password policy for all users:

- Copy IAM users sign-in link from IAM Dashboard
- Sign out as root user

**Step 5**: Sign in with new IAM user:

- Browse to IAM users sign-in link
- Sign in using new IAM user credentials

**Step 6**: Store root user credentials in a secure place

### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

**Recommendation**: Require MFA for:

- Account root user login
- All other IAM user logins

**Control**: Can also use MFA to control programmatic access.

**Options**: Virtual MFA apps, U2F security keys, hardware MFA devices.

## AWS CloudTrail

**[[AWS CloudTrail]]**: Service that logs all API requests to resources in your account.

**Purpose**: Enables **[[Operational Auditing]]** on your account.

### Default Configuration

**Enabled by default**: CloudTrail is enabled on account creation for all AWS accounts.

**Retention**: Keeps record of last **90 days** of account management event activity.

**Access**: Can view and download last 90 days of activity for create, modify, and delete operations without manually creating another trail.

### Extended Configuration

**For longer retention**: Create a new trail to:

- Enable CloudTrail log retention beyond 90 days
- Enable alerting when specified events occur

**Trail creation**: Involves specifying S3 bucket for log storage and configuring event types to log.

## Billing Reports

**Recommendation**: Enable billing reports for new AWS accounts.

**[[AWS Cost and Usage Report]]**: Provides information about:

- Use of AWS resources
- Estimated costs for that use

**Delivery**: AWS delivers reports to Amazon S3 bucket you specify.

**Update frequency**: AWS updates reports at least once per day.

**Tracking**: Tracks usage in AWS account and provides estimated charges by hour or by day.

**Purpose**: Helps monitor costs and identify unexpected spending.

## Practical Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Shared Responsibility Identification

Your company is migrating an application to AWS. For each component, identify whether AWS or the customer is responsible for security:

a) Physical server hardware b) Application code c) Operating system patches on EC2 d) S3 bucket encryption settings e) Network firewalls between data centers f) IAM user password policies g) RDS database software updates h) Security group rules i) DDoS protection at edge locations j) Application-level logging

### Scenario 2: IAM Architecture Design

Design an IAM structure for a company with:

- 5 developers (need EC2, S3, RDS access)
- 3 QA testers (need read-only access to EC2 and S3)
- 2 administrators (need full access)
- 1 billing person (needs billing access only)

Describe:

- How many groups you'd create and what they're called
- What permissions each group should have
- Whether you'd use managed or inline policies
- How you'd handle someone changing roles

### Scenario 3: Root Account Security Incident

You discover someone has been using your AWS root account for daily operations, and the access keys are stored in a text file on a shared network drive. No MFA is enabled.

Create a step-by-step plan to:

- Immediately secure the account
- Transition to proper IAM usage
- Implement proper security measures
- Prevent this from happening again

### Scenario 4: Cross-Account Access

Your company (Account A) needs to allow a partner company (Account B) temporary access to specific S3 buckets for a 3-month project.

Design a solution using IAM roles that:

- Grants the minimum necessary permissions
- Doesn't require sharing long-term credentials
- Can be easily revoked when the project ends
- Provides audit logging of all access

### Scenario 5: MFA Implementation Strategy

You're tasked with implementing MFA for all users in your AWS organization. You have:

- 50 regular users
- 10 administrators
- 5 automated systems needing API access

Design an MFA implementation strategy addressing:

- Which type of MFA to use for each user type
- How to handle the automated systems
- Rollout plan and timeline
- What to do if someone loses their MFA device

---

## Security Best Practices Checklist

Use this checklist when setting up a new AWS account:

- [ ] Stop using root user for daily tasks
- [ ] Create IAM users for each person
- [ ] Enable MFA on root user
- [ ] Enable MFA on all IAM users
- [ ] Create IAM groups with appropriate permissions
- [ ] Assign users to groups (not individual policies)
- [ ] Follow principle of least privilege
- [ ] Enable CloudTrail logging
- [ ] Create CloudTrail trail for long-term retention
- [ ] Enable billing reports
- [ ] Set up billing alerts
- [ ] Rotate access keys regularly
- [ ] Remove unused credentials
- [ ] Use roles for EC2 instances (not embedded keys)
- [ ] Enable password policy requirements
- [ ] Store root credentials securely
- [ ] Document security procedures
- [ ] Review IAM policies regularly
- [ ] Monitor CloudTrail logs for suspicious activity
- [ ] Use resource-based policies where appropriate

---

## Policy Evaluation Flowchart

Understand this decision flow:

1. Is there an **Explicit Deny**?
    
    - YES → **DENY ACCESS** (Stop here)
    - NO → Continue to step 2
2. Is there an **Explicit Allow**?
    
    - YES → **ALLOW ACCESS**
    - NO → Continue to step 3
3. Apply **Implicit Deny** (default) → **DENY ACCESS**
    

**Key principle**: Explicit Deny always wins, regardless of any Allow statements.

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Using root user for daily tasks** - Violates security best practices
2. **Sharing IAM credentials** - Create individual users instead
3. **Overly permissive policies** - Follow least privilege principle
4. **Not enabling MFA** - Leaves accounts vulnerable
5. **Embedding access keys in code** - Use IAM roles instead
6. **Forgetting to rotate credentials** - Implement regular rotation
7. **Not monitoring CloudTrail** - Miss security incidents
8. **Inline policies everywhere** - Use managed policies for reusability
9. **No password policy** - Weak passwords compromise security
10. **Not testing policies** - Use policy simulator before deployment
