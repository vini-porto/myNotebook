# What is SharePoint?

**[[SharePoint]]** is a cloud-based service provided by Microsoft that allows users to:

- Create **personal or team websites** for storing and organizing files
- Share documents and folders with specific people or groups
- Collaborate in real-time on shared content
- Manage **permissions** to control who can view, edit, or contribute

# Key Concepts

## SharePoint Sites

A **[[SharePoint Site]]** is a personal or team workspace that acts as a hub for content and collaboration. 

**What it includes:**

- A customizable homepage
- Document libraries (similar to folders on your computer, but accessible from anywhere)
- Built-in **templates** for different purposes (education, business, news, personal projects, etc.)

# Document Libraries and Folder Structure

## Document Libraries

A **[[Document Library]]** is the primary storage location within a SharePoint site. It functions like a file system where you can:

- Upload files
- Create folders and subfolders
- Organize content hierarchically
- Share specific folders with others

## Hierarchical Organization

**[[Hierarchical Organization]]** means arranging content in a tree-like structure with parent folders containing subfolders.

**Example structure from the lab:**

```
Shared Documents/
├── Courses/
│   ├── Course 1
│   ├── Course 2
│   ├── Course 3
│   ├── Course 4
│   ├── Course 5
│   └── Course 6
├── Projects/
├── Notes/
├── References/
└── Assignments/
```

**Why this matters:** Organizing files into clear categories makes it easier to:

- Locate specific documents quickly
- Share relevant folders with teammates without giving access to everything
- Maintain a clean, professional workspace

# Permissions and Sharing

**[[Permissions]]** in SharePoint control what users can do within a site. The two main permission levels discussed in this lab are:

|Permission Level|What They Can Do|
|---|---|
|**Member**|View, upload, edit, and delete files. Can participate in collaboration but cannot change site settings or add/remove other users.|
|**Owner**|Full control over the site. Can add/remove users, change permissions, modify site structure, and delete the site.|

**Why it matters:** Proper permission management ensures:

- **Security:** Only authorized people access sensitive content
- **Collaboration:** Team members have appropriate access to contribute
- **Control:** Site owners maintain authority over critical settings

# Cloud Accessibility

**[[Cloud Computing]]** is the foundation of SharePoint. Your files are stored on Microsoft's servers (the cloud) rather than on a single physical device.

**Benefits:**

- **Access anywhere:** View and edit files from any device with internet access (laptop, phone, tablet)
- **Automatic backups:** Files are protected against device failure or loss
- **Version history:** SharePoint tracks changes, allowing you to restore previous versions of documents
- **No storage limits:** Unlike a physical hard drive, cloud storage can be expanded as needed
