Each IPv4 address is really a **32-digit binary number** (just 1s and 0s).

**Example:** `192.168.1.45`
- Each number (192, 168, 1, 45) is called an "octet"
- Each octet is 8 binary digits
- 4 octets × 8 digits = 32 total digits

Every IP address has two parts:
- **Network part** (the neighborhood)
- **Host part** (the house number)
