**CLI** means Command Line Interface. It's like texting your router instead of using buttons and menus.
### Getting Connected
You need a special cable called a **console cable**. One end goes to your laptop, the other to a special port on the router. It's like a direct phone line to the device.
### Three Levels of Access

Think of it like security clearance levels:

1. **User Mode** (Router>)
	- You're a visitor
	- Can look around but can't touch anything
	- Very limited access

2. **Privileged Mode** (Router#)
	- You're the supervisor
	- Can see everything and restart things
	- Can't change settings but can save them

3. **Configuration Mode** (Router(config)#)
	- You're the boss
	- Can change any setting
	- This is where the real work happens
### Two Types of Memory
1. **Running Config** - What's happening right now. Like the current settings on your phone.
2. **Startup Config** - What loads when you restart. Like your phone's saved settings that come back after a reboot.
## The Big Picture

Networks are like cities with postal systems:

- Each layer has a specific job
- Standards make everything work together
- [[TCP-IP]] is what actually runs the internet
- CLI lets you configure the equipment that makes it all work
