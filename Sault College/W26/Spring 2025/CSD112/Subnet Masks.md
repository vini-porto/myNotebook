A **subnet mask** is a number that helps divide an **IP address** into two parts. It helps computers know which devices are **on the same local network** and which ones they need to **reach through a router**.

- one part identifies the **network**,
- and the other part identifies the **specific device (host)** on that network.

For example, if your IP address is `192.168.1.10` and your subnet mask is `255.255.255.0`, it means:
- `192.168.1` is the **network**,
- `10` is the **device** on that network.
