A client is part of a system called [[client-server model]] that the main function relies on rending and receiving data through a network with the server. 

[[Web Browsers]] are clients to connect to the [[Server]] and retrieve web pages for display.

# Types of client
## Thick
A thick client process any operations itself and doesn't rely necessarily on a [[Server]] (e.g: your [[Personal Computer]] its an example of thick client because it has a large set of features and it doesn't rely on the [[Server]] side for most of them).

## Thin
A thin client is a minimal sort of client. It usually only presets processed data given by a [[Web Application]] (e.g Office Web Apps are an example of thin clients).
