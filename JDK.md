# What is the [[JDK]]

The Java Development Kit ([[JDK]]) is a complete software package that contains all the tools you need to write, compile, debug and run [[Java]] programs.

It's a complete toolbox for java developers.

---
# Main Components

## Development Tools

`javac` — the [[compiler]] that converts your `.java` files into [[bytecode]] (`.class` files)

`java` — the launcher that runs your compiled programs

`jdb` — the debugger for finding and fixing bugs

`javadoc` — generates documentation from your code

## Java Runtime Environment (JRE)

The [[Java Virtual Machine]] (JVM) that actually runs your programs

Core [[Java libraries]] that provide pre-built functionality

## Standard Java Libraries

Thousands of pre-written [[classes]] for common tasks (e.g. working with files, networks, databases, etc.)

# JDK vs JRE vs JVM

**[[JVM]]**: The engine that runs Java programs (part of [[#Java Runtime Environment (JRE)]])

[[#Java Runtime Environment (JRE)]]**: JVM + libraries needed to _run_ Java programs (for end users)

JDK**: [[#Java Runtime Environment (JRE)]] + development tools to _create_ Java programs (for developers)

> [!NOTE] 
> If you just want to run Java apps, you need the JRE. If you want to develop Java apps, you need the JDK
