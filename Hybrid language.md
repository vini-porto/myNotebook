A hybrid programming language uses both a compiler and an interpreter for its execution process.

---
# Process

1. The source code is first compiled into an intermediate code, often called **bytecode** or intermediate language (IL). 
2. This [[Bytecode]] is then executed by an interpreter or a virtual machine (e.g., the [[Java Virtual Machine]])
3. The interpreter often uses Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation to further compile frequently used bytecode into native machine code for better performance.
