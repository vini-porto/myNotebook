# Definition

Compute refers to the processing power and resources required to perform calculations, execute instructions, and process data. 

While we often think of "computing" as the act of using a computer, "compute" (used as a [[noun]]) specifically describes the engine of mathematical logic that allows software to run. 

>It is the "brainpower" provided by hardware to transform input into output.

# Key Concepts

- **[[CPU]] (Central Processing Unit):** it handles general-purpose tasks and follows basic instructions from software.
    
- **[[GPU]] (Graphics Processing Unit):** Originally for rendering images, GPUs are now vital for "high-density compute" tasks like [[Artificial Intelligence]] and video processing because they can do many small calculations simultaneously.
    
- **[[RAM]] (Memory):** Memory provides the workspace. Compute needs data to be nearby in RAM to process it quickly.
    
- **[[Throughput]]:** A measure of how much work a compute system can do in a given amount of time.
    
- **[[Latency]]:** The delay before a compute resource begins a task.

## How it Works

Compute functions through a cycle of fetching, decoding, and executing instructions. Here is the simplified flow:

1. **Instruction Fetch:** The compute resource (like a CPU) pulls an instruction from the [[Memory]].
    
2. **Logic Processing:** The hardware uses logic gates to perform arithmetic (like $1 + 1$) or logical comparisons (is $A > B$?).
    
3. **Clock Speed:** This process is measured in [[Hertz]]. A 3GHz processor can perform three billion "cycles" or opportunities for compute per second.
    
4. **Scaling:** When one computer isn't enough, we use **[[Cloud Computing]]** to link thousands of processors together to create massive compute power.

## Examples

- **Personal Use:** When you click a button on a website, your browser uses local **compute** to render the animation and process your click.
    
- **Data Science:** Training a [[Machine Learning]] model requires massive amounts of compute to crunch through millions of data points to find patterns.
    
- **Gaming:** A video game uses compute to calculate physics (how a ball bounces) and AI behavior (how an enemy moves).
    
- **Cloud Services:** Services like AWS or Google Cloud sell "Compute Instances," which are essentially virtual slices of powerful servers rented out to users.
