# Definition

[[Linguistics]] is the scientific study of language, and it views English not just as a list of words to memorize, but as a structured system built on five fundamental pillars.

# Phonetics and Phonology

Before we write or read, we produce sound. This pillar focuses on how we physically create sounds and how those sounds function within a language.

- **Phonemes:** These are the smallest units of sound that can change the meaning of a word. For example, the difference between "cat" and "bat" is a single phoneme: /k/ vs /b/.

>[!NOTE] Key Concept
>English is not a [[phonetic language]] meaning we don't always spell words the way they sound (e.g., "tough" vs "though").

> **Example:** Consider the letter 'a' in "apple" versus "father." The physical symbol is the same, but the phonemes are different.

# Morphology

Morphology is the study of how words are formed

---

- **Morphemes:** The smallest units of meaning.

- **Free Morphemes:** Words that can stand alone (e.g., "kind").

- **Bound Morphemes:** [[Prefixes]] or [[Suffixes]] that must be attached to a word to have meaning (e.g., "-ness").

- **Combined:** "Kind" + "ness" = "Kindness."

# Syntax

Syntax is the set of rules, principles, and processes that govern the structure of sentences. It dictates the order of words so that they make sense to a listener.

---

- **Standard Order:** English primarily follows a **Subject-Verb-Object (SVO)** structure.
    
    - _Correct:_ "The chef (S) cooked (V) the meal (O)."
    
    - _Incorrect:_ "The meal cooked the chef." (This is syntactically correct but semantically strange!)
    

# Semantics

Semantics focuses on the literal meaning of words and sentences. It is the bridge between the structures we build (syntax) and the ideas we want to express.

---

- **Denotation:** The literal dictionary definition of a word.

- **Connotation:** The emotional or cultural feeling associated with a word. For example, "childish" and "youthful" have similar literal meanings, but very different connotations.

# Pragmatics

Pragmatics is often called "social language." It explores how context contributes to meaning. It is the difference between what we say and what we actually mean.

---

- **Example:** If someone asks, "Can you pass the salt?" they aren't asking if you have the physical strength to lift the salt shaker (literal). They are making a polite request for you to give it to them (pragmatic).
