# Definition

In [[linguistics]], the categories you are referring to Nouns, Verbs, Adverbs, and others fall under the study of **Morphology** and **Syntax**. These are known as **Part of Speech** or **Lexical Categories**.

# Open Classes (Content Words)

These classes are "open" because we constantly add new words to them (like "email" or "blog"). They carry the primary imagery and meaning of a sentence.

- **[[Nouns]]:** Words that identify people, places, things, or ideas.
    
    - _Examples:_ Teacher, London, Table, Freedom.
    
- **[[Verbs]]:** Words that describe actions or states of being.
    
    - _Examples:_ Run, Speak, Is, Seem.
    
- **[[Adjectives]]:** Words that modify or describe nouns.
    
    - _Examples:_ **Blue** sky, **Enormous** building.
    
- **[[Adverbs]]:** Words that modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs. They often tell us how, when, where, or to what extent.
    
    - _Examples:_ He ran **quickly**. She is **very** tall.


# Closed Classes (Function Words)

These classes rarely change. They act as the "glue" that connects the content words together to create logical relationships.

- **[[Pronouns]]:** Words that replace nouns to avoid repetition.
    
    - _Examples:_ I, You, He, She, It, They.
    
- **[[Prepositions]]:** Words that show the relationship in time or space between other words.
    
    - _Examples:_ The cat is **on** the mat. We met **after** lunch.
    
- **[[Conjunctions]]:** Words that connect words, phrases, or clauses.
    
    - _Examples:_ And, But, Or, Because.
    
- **[[Determiners]]:** Words that introduce a noun and provide context like quantity or possession.
    
    - _Examples:_ **The** dog, **Some** apples, **My** car.

# How They Work Together (The Syntax Connection)

While **Morphology** defines what these words are, **Syntax** defines where they go. A word's "part of speech" can actually change depending on its position and function in a sentence. This is a unique feature of English.

---

> **The "Work" Example:**
> 
> 1. I have a lot of **work** to do. (Here, "work" is a **Noun**—an object).
>    
> 2. I **work** at the library. (Here, "work" is a **Verb**—an action).
>    

# Why This Matters

Understanding these categories allows you to use [[Derivational Morphology]]. This is the ability to take one "root" word and transform it into different parts of speech by adding prefixes or suffixes.

---

- **Act** (Verb)

- **Action** (Noun)

- **Active** (Adjective)

- **Actively** (Adverb)
